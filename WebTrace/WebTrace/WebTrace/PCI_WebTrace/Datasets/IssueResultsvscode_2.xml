- VSCode Version: Dec 2017
- OS Version: Windows 10 (Latest stable)
- Integrated Terminal: Powershell (With no user profile)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open integrated terminal
2. Type something
3. I suddenly want to remove these commands.
4. Then I try Ctrl+C (This works in Powershell)
5. But VSCode just adds a ^C after the command, doesn't start a new line.
6. Then I try Ctrl+[Backspace] (Also works in Powershell)
6. But VSCode just adds a ^W after the command, doesn't behave like Powershell (remove a block.)
7. So I have to long-press on [Backspace]
/** 8. Then I found I can Ctrl+A then [Backspace] */

    <Title>Search and Replace in broken in files using only CR as line-ending</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.19.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 (1709)

It appears that there is a bug with the search and replace functionality. It is encountered when editing multiple XML files. I have recorded a screen capture to illustrate the issue.

https://youtu.be/ehuqer244S4

Content of one XML file:

```xml
&lt;assets&gt;
	&lt;output mode="c" filename="../../../assetlist/_generated/I_NOTE_HELP000/header.h" rcname="../../../assetlist/_generated/I_NOTE_HELP000/assetR" fileList="g_fileNames" pathprefix="data/"/&gt;
	&lt;asset source="%ED8_PSV%/data/images/note/help/note_help000foo" symbol="I_NOTE_HELP000"/&gt;
&lt;/assets&gt;

```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a folder containing a bunch of XML files.
2. *Search and replace* a string as shown in the video.
3. Observe the changes done to the XML files.

    <Title>Reverting Emmet's Remove Tag command results in autoclosing opening tag</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issue to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.19.1
- OS Version: Ubuntu 17.10

If `html.autoClosingTags` is set to `true`, reverting `Emmet: Remove Tag` command (e.g. with &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;) results in duplicate closing tag.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Make sure that `"html.autoClosingTags": true` in Settings.
2. Write some HTML tags:
```html
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```
2. Move cursor to the opening (or closing) `div` tag.
3. Run `Emmet: Remove Tag` command. Tag is properly removed.
4. Press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Z&lt;/kbd&gt;.
5. Stare at:
```html
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;
Reproduces without extensions: Yes, as Emmet is a built-in extension.
Not reproduced in Sublime Text with the same Emmet command, so it is more related to VSCode than to Emmet I believe.

Workaround: set `"html.autoClosingTags": false` in Settings.

    <Title>Latest upgrade to Version 1.19.1 (1.19.1) breaks Jest Test Debugging Capabilities</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issue to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: Version 1.19.1 (1.19.1)
- OS Version: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1421)

Hi there, I suspect the newest update might be breaking the Jest debugging. Here's my config taken straight from [Jest's website](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/troubleshooting.html#debugging-in-vs-code): .

 _Note: I'm using the CRA setup_


```
{
      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/client/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect-brk", "test"],
      "args": ["--runInBand", "--no-cache", "--env=jsdom"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/client",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
}
```

Steps to Reproduce:

When I try to start debugging (which I can confirm was working with previous versions) I now get the error:
`Error: Cannot connect to runtime process, timeout after 10000 ms - (reason: Cannot connect to the target: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3269)`.

Could you please point me to what I'm missing?

    <Title>Integrated Terminal Font Abnormalities</Title>
    <Description>The integrated terminal is inserting abnormal letter spacing.  This seems to be a recurrence of an issue that appeared around the October time frame and was since corrected -- now reoccurring. The issue is present on both 'cmd' and 'powershell' terminals. Issue persists through save, shut down, restart and clean reboot.  Was successfully reproduced with over 20 different fonts.

    <Title>[Debug] Cannot launch multiple programs in integrated terminal</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.19.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Install [java-debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
2. Use vscode to open java project, add two launch configurations on `launch.json`, and both configurations' console setting is `integratedTerminal`.
3. Launch the first one, and you see `Java Debug Console` channel added to integrated terminal.
4. Try to launch the second one, timeout. No new terminal channel is created. 

See the gif below. The two launchInTerminal commands are sent to the same shell terminal, but the first debug session is still running so that the second one is pending. You see if i stop the first one, the second the runInTerminal commands shows up immediately at the same terminal.

![cannotlaunchinterminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14052197/34344968-4165e5f6-ea26-11e7-932c-c5df693aecb7.gif)

**Expected behavior**:

- Users should be able to launch multiple programs in integrated terminal
- Each program should have its own terminal created

It would be really helpful to add Rename to the tab content menu.  You want this behavior because -

1. You don't want to disturb the left stuff like search.
2. Navigating on the left requires multiple clicks

A keyboard shortcut would even be better!

1. Download VS Code.
2. Launch VS Code.
3. Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
4. Open terminal and verify path -

```
🐳 $ ls -la /usr/local/bin/code

/usr/local/bin
```

5. Do something else but I don't know what.  What generates a new GUID?

6. Try to execute `code` from the command line and it says 
```
🐨 $ code
-bash: /usr/local/bin/code: No such file or directory
```

7. Open VS Code from spotlight.

8. Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.

1.consider the above program, running it in the integrated terminal doesn't print upto 99(hello world 99). It stops randomly in the middle. (stops at 65,85.. and even 2)
2.I tried with three different terminals (command prompt, git Bash, developer command prompt for visual studio). The same happens for all of them.
3. The above three terminals work perfectly file externally.
I searched everywhere in the internet but could find similar result.

- OS Version: Darwin x64 17.2.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a multi-root workspace with multiple projects that has a file name with the same name.
2. Press Cmd-P (on Mac) to search for a file:

&lt;img width="891" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/630613/34200946-9e20db0c-e57b-11e7-8ce9-b33a14370342.png"&gt;

It _works_, but what if I want to be able to search for a file in a particular project?

&lt;img width="866" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/630613/34200975-aef42fba-e57b-11e7-85c9-a6ebd5f4cfa2.png"&gt;

IMHO, the search function should include the "project name" as part of the searchable tokens somehow, so that you can find files _in a particular project_ if you happen to know its name.

(This is more of an annoyance than a huge problem. I just started to use multi-root workspaces the other day, a great feature - thanks a lot for implementing it! 🍰)</Description>

- VSCode Version: 1.18.0
- OS Version: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
- Machine: Mac Book Pro (early 2015, not the one with only USB-C)
- What I am using: zsh with Oh-My-Zsh (latest)

When disconnecting from a display integrated terminal becomes blurry and when trying to input or resizing the terminal, display becomes raw un-organized UTF-8 characters (with the wrong font size)
When typing A (U+0041) it displays z(U+007A)
typing z (U+007A) gives us å(U+005E)
typing x (U+0078) gives us á(U+00E1)
(checked and there are no apparent correlations bitwise or spanwise)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Connect mac to display (HDMI cable) and close the laptop to only use the attached display
2. Use VSCode a bit
3. Disconnect the cable and open up your laptop -&gt; the terminal can't display correctly :(

Way to make it work again: open a new tab and close your old one.

    <Title>[Feature Request] Improve search usability by merging the global and local search widgets</Title>
    <Description>Currently there are two separate search widgets, one for global search in the activity bar on the left, and one for local search inside the file editor. Each search comes with separately colored results, a separate set of keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results, etc. Both searches can be active at the same time showing mixed search results within the same file. This is confusing and cumbersome to use for most search scenarios.

To improve usability I propose to merge the two search widgets (at least as a configurable option) so there will only be a single search widget in the activity bar, with single set of search results, single set of navigation keys, etc. Just add a search scope selector (`all files` | `current folder` | `current file`), that can be used to quickly select over which file(s) the search should be performed. Consequently the local search widget inside the editor will no longer be needed and can be removed from view (solving also the overlap issue it creates with the top of the edited file).

    <Title>Ability to name individual terminal sessions</Title>
    <Description>Feature request

I would like to be able to name individual terminal sessions, I sometimes have as many as 4 terminals running in the same workspace doing various things and being able to give them names would make it easier to remember what each is doing so i can navigate between them better.

Right now they all say `#: bash` which is cool to tell me which type of CLI I'm using but, for me at least, they are always going to be bash. It would be cool to see `#: bash (runserver)`, `#: bash (cronjobs)`, `#: bash (unittests)`, etc... some way to at a glance know what each is doing.

    <Title>Support video in markdown preview</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.19.0

It would be nice if the markdown preview supported some kind of proper video format, so extension authors don't have to resort to massive GIFs. I would suggest that the simplest way is to use the same syntax as images, i.e. `![alt text](my_video.mp4)` and convert it to a `&lt;video&gt;` if the file name ends with a supported video type (I guess just `.mp4` and `.webm`). I found a (long) discussion about the syntax [here](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/embedded-audio-and-video/441/97), with no conclusion.

Alternatively, the `&lt;video&gt;` tag could be whitelisted, like `&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;img&gt;` already are. That might be easier and cleaner.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. I'm using Insiders and trying to pipe output from the terminal running Unbuntu to the editor.
2. I tried a simple: cat .bashrc | code-insiders

Nothing happens. I thought perhaps it was an issue with Windows not having access to the file under WSL so I also tried something under /mnt/c and had the same response. Note, I can "which code-insiders" in Ubuntu and it correctly sees the proper path to my install.

many of us actually spend more time reviewing code instead of writing, those button can work with mouse without the need of reaching keyboard. Besides, most  editors support the quick action buttons long time ago.

    <Title>Environment variables on Windows should not be case-sensitive</Title>
    <Description>- Version 1.19.0
- Commit 816be6780ca8bd0ab80314e11478c48c70d09383
- OS Version: Windows 10.0.16299.64

Steps to Reproduce:

1. On a machine where `WINDIR` is actually `windir` (seems to have changed case on Win10 or at some point in the past), use "${env:WINDIR}" in .vscode/launch.json, e.g.: ${env:WINDIR}/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe
2. Launch the task. Debug output says /System32/... is not found (note no prefix, e.g. C:/Windows)

Environment variables on Windows are not case-sensitive, and they change. For example, my PATH is always PATH. I often override this as one of my first machine set up steps. It was always PATH in the past, as it is on other platforms. Windows 10 or perhaps 8 changed the case. So developers across Windows versions can't use a checked in launch.json (or tasks.json, etc.)? That's not a practical expectation.

    <Title>Regression issue with debug in WSL</Title>
    <Description>Debug in WSL is broken on the latest version 1.19.0, it used to work in v1.18.
- VSCode Version: 1.19.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Setup a Typescript project (I guess it has the same issue with any NodeJS project), with a file server.ts
```js
console.log("testing..."); // Set a breakpoint here
```
2. Configure launch.json with:
```js
{
      "name": "Current TS File",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "useWSL": true,
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/ts-node/dist/_bin.js",
      "args": [
        "${relativeFile}"
      ],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "protocol": "inspector"
}
```
3. Open server.ts, press F5 to run
4. Notice the error as attached. Obviously the path of the current file (${relativeFile}) is incorrect, it's supposed to be /src/server.ts, but the log in the debug console shows: \src\server.ts. This worked correctly in the previous version.

    <Title>Add a way to choose theme variant (Gnome dark/light theme)</Title>
    <Description>Hello,

A lot of GTK themes come with 2 variants like the default Gnome theme Adwaita . One light and one dark. Each app that implement the feature, like Gnome terminal, allow you to choose the theme variant in the preference. It will be awesome if we can do this in Vs Code.

The dark theme suit Vs Code a lot better !

    <Title>Multi Target debug - ECONNREFUSED with Console - integrated terminal</Title>

Multiple launch.json setups ran together fail with "Cannot connect to the target: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9228" for any configs with:
`"console": "integratedTerminal"`

Example:
```json
"version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Editor",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "run-script",
                "debug"
            ],
            "port": 9228,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/Editor",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Engine",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "run-script",
                "debug"
            ],
            "port": 9229,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/engine",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Applications",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "run-script",
                "debug"
            ],
            "port": 9227,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/applications",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ],
    "compounds": [
        {
            "name": "All Servers",
            "configurations": ["Editor", "Engine", "Applications"]
        }
    ]
}
```
Took a while to narrow the error down to this setup. Each application individually runs ok but when ran together I get the error. 

I'm guessing "console": "externalTerminal" maybe my answer but struggling to find an example of setting this up.

I work on the same folder (on external hard drive) from two PCs. I made a lot of changes to a certain file at home, then the next day I come to work, plug in my drive, start my development server (which showed the latest version of my app), and start up VS code. It starts with three open files. I make a small change to one of them and save, and the app stops working. Then I realize that the rest of that file is a very early version that I had made a lot of changes to, so obviously it doesn't work with the rest of the app anymore.

How did it manage to pull out such an early version (even earlier than I had when I left work last night), and then used it to overwrite the current version without a warning? VS Code was not running that whole time, I literally just started it up. I don't have these files under version control.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In the git repo, made some changes
2. when you click the gutter and make revert changes, it'll auto go to next changes

[DEMO](https://vimeo.com/247432763)

This is annoying and we lose our focus on the document. 

Also below shortcut is not working. We need to manually click the button

```
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+z",
  "command": "git.revertChange"
}
```
Basically it's should work as PHPStorm.

I'm reopening #38551 to get some attention and as it was closed while not fixed, as it's a major problem.

Unlike what was announced, VS Code 1.19 doesn't solve the issue of broken auto imports, so it will be two months (at least) with an automatic feature producing broken code activated by default. That's just incomprehensible...

Or TS 2.6.2 should have included the fix, or TS 2.7 fix should have been backported in VS Code, or PR #38552 to temporatily disable auto imports by default until TS does its job well should have been accepted, but the current situation is just bad.</Description>

    <Description>
- VSCode Version: Version 1.19.0 (1.19.0)
- OS Version: MacOS 10.13.2 (17C88)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Search some text in the file view panel, either by highlight the text then press ctrl-e, or by press ctrl-f and type in the text.
2. Now click the search magnifying glass on the side bar to show the global search bar, the search text in step 1 is not in the global search field.

Expected behavior:

The text in the global search field should sync with the text in the edit find search field. It was this way two versions back.

    <Title>VSCode window starts slightly offset from bottom of screen</Title>
    <Description>Copy/paste from Reddit:

I'm on WIndows 10 Pro running 64-bit VSCode 1.18.1. I usually snap the VSCode app to the right side of my 3440x1440 screen. When I close and then restart VSCode, the bottom of the window has moved up a tad and the right side of the window has moved in ever so slightly. Can reproduce with and without using Windows' window snapping.

Not a big issue but the gap on the bottom drives me nuts.

    <Title>Make VSCode available in the Windows Store</Title>
    <Description>Is there a reason why is VS Code not in Microsoft's own app store? Can't this be done easily with the Desktop Bridge ("Centennial")? This would remove the need to manually update the app on every new version and offload that action to the OS. Also, Microsoft putting their on apps on the Store would make it more appealing for devs to move to the new app platform. I can't wait to ditch old Win32 installers.</Description>

    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.18.1

I have been having this issue with the vscode integrated terminal for probably 6 months now. The terminal appears to become 'corrupted' while running scripts like webpack or jest running in the terminal. Powershell formatting settings appear to 'bleed through' and make the terminal unreadable. I have reinstalled VScode with no effect as well as reset powershell's formatting settings with 'Set-PSReadlineOption -ResetTokenColors` to no effect.

I am not using any terminal setting that I am aware of and using Dark+ (default dark), which I believe to be completely stock. (I've tried every setting that I can think of.) The problem will persist with other themes.

Here is what it looks like:

![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6851336/33971414-ee5de8be-e03d-11e7-8e57-47022319fe4a.PNG)

I believe that I have identified a workaround by enabling 'legacy mode' in powershell, which can be done by opening a full powershell and choosing properties &gt; options &gt; 'Use legacy console (requires relaunch)'.

As demonstrated here:

![console fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6851336/33971500-6250b6d4-e03e-11e7-81a7-f5c6d48a7ffd.PNG)

This appears to resolve the immediate issue, however, if one attempts to use bash, you will now receive the error: 'Unsupported console settings. In order to use this feature the legacy console must be disabled.'

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 Home Edition (64 bit)

Hi guys,

I have a **problem with indexing** for both my web(default support) and Python(with the official Python extension installed) projects (**22k files &amp; 30k files projects**). For some of those(web projects) VSCode works fine but for the others I **can't find any files in Go to file and Search in files, excluding those I already opened** with the editor.

I **deleted any cache/settings** both for my **user and folder** and even **uninstalled**(then re-installed) VSCode but it still occurs in the same projects. I **tried the Insiders build(1.19.0-insider)** and it doesn't seem to be solved(yet) there. In addition, I **double verified** my user and folder **"search.exclude"** and **"files.exclude"** settings.

**NOTE: I originally commented here(requested to open a new issue):**

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39440#issuecomment-350900107

**It seems to be the exact _same problem_, but for medium sized projects**

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the problematic project

Steps to Reproduce:

2.switch to other tabs
3.switch back to the tab opened in the first step.

I don't know whether this is a feature or not. Just feel a little annoy have to scroll a little when switching back from other tabs if the info page is very long. The result I expect is not reloading or just keep the old scroll position. I usually open the online doc for reference.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. create task with:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "command": "clear ; echo hi; clear; echo bye",
            "type": "shell",
            "args": [],
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always",
                "echo": false,
                "panel": "dedicated"
            },
            "label": "test"
        }
    ]
}
```
2. note that when finished terminal does *not* output `Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.`
3. try to run task again
4. vscode complains that task is already running `The task 'test (foo)' is already active. To terminate it use 'Terminate Task...' from the Tasks menu.`
5. note that if second `clear`  is removed from the `command` string, terminal behaves as expected.  removing first `clear` but leaving the second still causes the issue.

This used to work fine; not sure if it was a newer version of vscode or mac OS that broke things.

    <Title>Category based coding</Title>
    <Description>Hello,
I would like to recommend a feature. 
Problem /Current Challenge: 
I many time manage multiple segments of a code base. For example, I may open a repo containing both client and server side code. 
Say on the client I am opening files related to the frontend login service. Then I am targeting backend login service. Each aspect (backend/frontend) contains multiple files. 

Current Solution - With Pain and Confusion
Current easy solution for this is opening each folder on separate vscode windows. However, we know that this feature is really meant for project distinction, not a category of my codebase. The function of opening separate windows also behaves according to that expectation. It's enough to have one more repo open alongside to make the number of vscode windows a pain to swap between.

Proposal 
It would be great if above the tabs of open files (horizontal layout of open files) it would be possible to add workspaces/files-category tabs.  They could potentially be swapped with, say, Ctrl-Shift-number.

Obviously all opened files will appear under the open category. 
I believe this will provide a more informative/mental categorization between categories of code.

This feature will allow mental isolation for focusing on:
- reviewing a framework and toggling its effect on the dependent code
- a payment system, frontend, backend mental isolation

    <Title>vscode forgets previously opened folders when opened by double-clicking an associated file.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: ALL
- OS Version: Windows 10 (probably all)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Configure vscode to reopen previously open windows when starting.
2. Open several folders in different windows.
3. Carefully close vscode using the Exit from the File menu so that it will surely remember to reopen them next time you start vscode. (I've had issues in the past on Linux where it wouldn't save the open window list if you used the close button. I don't know if that still exists, I don't do it anymore.)
4. Double-click a file whose file extension is associated with vscode.
5. The file opens in vscode, but no other vscode windows open.
6. Now there is no way to get vscode to open those windows that were previously saved to be reopened.

    <Title>Focus lost from editor when clicking into area below suggest docs</Title>
    <Description>Steps:
* open suggest with docs to the side
* click into the seemingly empty area below docs

I would expect suggest to close. Instead focus seems to be somewhere but not in the editor anymore, so that e.g keybindings navigation does not work anymore.

    <Title>hsl / hsla color swatches are incorrect for 0% saturation</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In a CSS file, define a property value with `hsl(0,0%,100%)` or `hsla(0,0%,100%,1)`
2. Wait for the color swatch to appear
3. The color should be white (100% lightness), but instead appears as black.  The pop-up color picker is likewise initialized to rgb(0,0,0).

The problem is specific to 0% saturation value; isn't affected by the hue value, and applies for any lightness value (e.g., 50% lightness should be gray).  Probably incorrect handling of a divide-by-zero error in the color conversion functions.

Steps to Reproduce:

Description:
When searching for multi line strings it appears that the default behavior of the search is to strip newlines from the paste. This prevents the search function from matching the string and therefore prevents multi line search and replaces.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Copy code in "Code used" and paste into a new empty file in vs code several times. 
2. Ctrl F and paste the code in Search.
3. 0 matches found since newlines are stripped.

Text to be searched.

The title bar and the menu bar are not very fit with the theme. For example, in visual studio, when I use the dark theme, the title bar and the menu bar are dark, too, while in vs code, they are not. Hope it could be improved, for I think VS code is almost perfect.

- OS Version: Arch Linux x86_64 

Steps to Reproduce: 

1. Open file in directory containing lots of files of the format filename_%d04.extension
2. Spend time scrolling in search for your code files in the sidebar because the sequence of numbered files is not collapsed into a single item.

Specifically my request is that: VS code detects file patterns of sequentially numbered files and allow collapsing (grouping) all files that match the sequence into a single item in the side-bar (e.g. in the same way as directories)

Hi, when I got error message on the top of vscode, the message is cut off so I can't get the whole message (show in the picture).

 I would like to request the feature to get complete message, such as right click on it and there's `copy full message` menuitem to select, or `expand the message panel` to see the complete message, thank you.

    <Title>Ability to perform find/replace only for open documents</Title>
    <Description>VSCode appears to support find/replace for the following:

- Current document
- Selection within current document
- Files in a particular folder(s) (with optional exclude filters)
- Files in entire project (with optional exclude filters)

This is great, but one thing seems missing--the ability to search "all open documents" (as you can with Visual Studio).

Is this possible? If not, could you please consider this a feature request?</Description>

    <Title>Not possible to adjust vertical size of activity bar items. Please provide a way to do it incl. bindable action.</Title>

- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063

I find it very strange that it isn't possible to change the heigth of activity bar panes. It's really annoying to have to scroll up and down when I have so many files open that I don't see all the file tabs. 

Please provide a way to adjust the width. It doesn't make sense to have fixed height, there is a lot of unused space especially if after panes are collapsed.

Pic for clarity, arrow indicates where the increase/decrease height functionality should be available. It would be awesome if you also provide action to switch between expanding the height to fill all the unused space and collapsing to the default height so we could bind a hotkey.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Open cca 8+ files
2.  Try to increase the heigth of the 'Open editors' pane.

    <Title>Search and Replace keep losing the selection</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.1
- OS Version: Windows 10
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Select a block of text (you want to replace occurrences of a word only in that block, not in the entire file)
2. Press Ctrl + H (Edit &gt; Replace in files)
3. Insert a word to be replaces, and the replacement in the next input box
4. Click the "In selection" toggle (if not toggled already), eventually click it again

Expected behavior: if you toggle/untoggle the "in selection", the selection should stay. Now it's not the case.

Also if you keep the search and replace dialog open, and try to select other portions of texts to apply the same replacement, it doesn't work.

Other major editors works well for this case, but Visual Studio Code doesn't work.

All clicks in the GIF, I make with the pressed Shift key:

![shift click](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/33240437-9102ed72-d2be-11e7-86e2-2d674c608800.gif)

So, in my opinion, the third click (and sixth one) should select part of code to that place.
Where from? Well, I think it should be from the first click. It will make sense.

Instead of it, the third click with pressed Shift - makes focus of previous selected code to get lost.

    <Description>I'm using the C++ extension on version 1.18.1 and have successfully set up a default build task. I'd like to further customize it:
* add an option to `presentation.reveal` to only present the output panel if there's an error, as detected by the selected problemMatcher - if my build succeeds I'd rather not pop up the panel.
* add an option to `presentation` to specify the tab in the panel that is shown, if it is revealed - in my case I'd like to show the `Problems` tab rather than the `Terminal` tab (can always switch over to the terminal for more detail if needed, but Problems tab is quicker to skim)

These options aren't currently listed at https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks but please let me know if there's another way to achieve this. Thanks for listening!</Description>

The file does exist relative to the workspace root, though from what I've read in related cases, it seems that you no longer do `fs.stat` when deciding to link. I've found many cases suggesting there have been improvements/fixes to this and screenshots showing it working, so I'm not sure what's different about ours.

Are the rules about what formats are detected documented anywhere for me to check? If not, what's the best way to debug?</Description>

    <Title>feature request: maintain editor view state optional</Title>
    <Description>I would like the option of "forgetting the view state" when an editor is closed.

Current behaviour:

1. Open any number of files in the editor, scroll down, select code, etc.
2. Close the editors
3. Re-open the files, they open in the same state. (scrolled, code selected)

I propose a configuration option;

"editor.forgetViewState": ["never","onEditorClose","onExit"]

1. "never" - is the current behavior
2. "onEditorClose" - will forget view state if you close the editor window.
3. "onExit" - even if you have editors open, on next restart they will not reopen

    <Title>files.autoGuessEncoding adds unnecessary modification markers on Git controlled projects</Title>
    <Description>I have a project hosted on GitHub and source controlled with VS Code.
The code files were previously created with some other code editors.
Since VS Code provided Git feature, I migrated to use it to commit and update the project.
After several commission and update, I found that VS Code was unable to detect some files' encoding, which were in GB2312.
Thus I turned on the `files.autoGuessEncoding` setting.
After that, the files were correctly displayed, but many modification marks were added to the editor.

    <Title>Add variable substitution to refer to a specific root folder of a multi-root workspace</Title>
    <Description>Currently, the settings provide the substitution `${workspaceFolder}` for finding the root of the currently active folder. For some projects, you may wish to refer to a different root folder of a multi-root workspace; an example of this: `~/projects/myApp` depends on `~/projects/myNpmPackage`.

With the above scenario, the `myApp.code-workspace` will look as follows:

```json
{
    "folders": [
        {
            "name": "my-npm-package",
            "path": "~/projects/myNpmPackage"
        },
        {
            "name": "app-that-deps-on-package",
            "path": "~/projects/myApp"
        }
    ]
}
```

It would be nice to have the ability to reference another workspace root for things such as source mapping with the `msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome` extension. A syntax for this could be along the lines of `${workspaceFolder:&lt;folder-name&gt;}`.

Using the aforementioned syntax in `~/projects/myApp/.vscode/launch.json` could look like this:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug My App in Chrome (Launch)",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "build-npm-package",
            "sourceMaps": true,
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "pathMapping": {
                "/myApp/node_modules/myNpmPackage": "${workspaceFolder:my-npm-package}",
                "/myApp": "${workspaceFolder}/public"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This yields the following advantages:

- I no longer have to worry about the relative location of the `myNpmPackage` folder when writing tasks, and can instead simply update `myApp.code-workspace`
- In `tasks.json`, I can now create the `build-npm-package` task to build `myNpmPackage` and copy any changes into the `node_modules` folder of `myApp`, avoiding having to manually copy anything 
- I no longer have to open two copies of source files from `myNpmPackage` while debugging, and am less likely to accidentally edit the `node_modules` version since it won't open when stepping through
- I can use workspace settings that can refer to multiple root folders in `myApp.code-workspace`
- These substitutions would make consolidating `task.json` or `launch.json` files into a single config easier if desired (or if a multi-root workspace supports a workspace-wide `tasks.json` or `launch.json` in the future)</Description>

    <Title>Change debugging tab to be tasks tab</Title>
    <Description>I run a lot of tasks in VSCode. I just can't see why there is such a big difference between running a debug process and a task. And maybe it is just me, but I think pressing &lt;kbd&gt;CMD&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt; and then select `Run Task` and then selecting the running task, is just too much.

For optimal experience, I suggest the following:

* A tasks should have a **play** button.
* A background task should have a **play** and **stop** button
* A debug tasks should **play**, **stop**, **resume**, **step into**, **step over**, **step out**, **restart**, **disconnect**.
* A task can depend on an another task.
* Pressing **start** should start the tasks and all its dependencies.
* Pressing **stop** should stop the tasks and all its dependencies.
* Being able to run multiple tasks.

When I debug task begins, the "normal" sidebar for debugging is overlayed over this task list.</Description>

    <Description>When doing a search, it would be useful to have an option to limit the search to files that have been modified since the last commit.

A toggle could be added to the 'files to include' field - similar to the 'use ignore files' and 'use exclude settings' toggles in the 'files to exclude' field.

It may also be helpful to limit the search to files that are currently open.

Steps to Reproduce:
The problem occurs when the source code folder path contains ' - ' character embedded surrounded by spaces in the path string. My default path for a OneDrive for Business path. 
"C:\Users\LarryA\OneDrive - Intact Partners Inc\VSCprojects\tsconfig.json" 

This fails: "C:\Users\LarryA\OneDrive - Intact Partners Inc\VSCprojects\tsconfig.json" 
This passes: "C:\Users\LarryA\OneDrive-IntactPartnersInc\VSCprojects\tsconfig.json"

1. Use the folder configurations above.
2. Follow the guide to create the HelloWorld project ( https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript )
3. Execute the Task: Run Build Tasks... as directed. The terminal window reports the error.

Pressing the "&gt;" is very common when writing php and html.

whenever i use this sign for example to close an html tag and hit "enter", an autocomplete window opens and if i ignore it, the string "$_COOKIE" is automatically printed, which foreces me to manually delete it or press the "esc" key to close the autocomplete window.

This is intrusive to my workflow and slows down my work.

You can see it in the attached image.

Please fix this in the next update.

Thank you !

I would expect to always find results, even in the second case.

    <Title>QuickOpen: Allow any order for search terms</Title>
    <Description>It could save a lot of time if the search terms in quickopen was not taken in order. I explain:

My project is like so:
![tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7150017/33075214-09890cb2-cec9-11e7-893e-e7dadcf9cc36.png)

If I search for `index` everything is fine, I get the expected 2 `index.js` files:
![result_index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7150017/33075281-3919d9fc-cec9-11e7-90fa-f6decfdce61d.png)

If I search for `bar index`, also I get the right `index.js` file:
![result_ok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7150017/33075320-5761c226-cec9-11e7-8e2c-7083aee921e5.png)

But often during my development i'm searching first by file name, and then I remember that there is not only one file named like this in my project, so I want to specify the "module" afterwards like this:

![result_ko](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7150017/33075360-7d0643c6-cec9-11e7-9c69-f61c211b65bb.png)

I think it would be a great idea to show the same results for `index bar` as the ones for `bar index` but only if there is no better matches.

Some example to illustrate with the following tree:

```
project/
├── indexable/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── bar.js
└── bar/
     ├── index.js
     └── bar.js
```

Search terms: `index bar`
Results:
`1st/` **index**able/**bar**.js (because the order of terms matches the file path)
`2nd/` **bar**/**index**.js  (as there is two matching terms, but in wrong order)

Search terms: `indexbar`
Results:
`1st/` **index**able/**bar**.js
_bar/index.js_ is not a match cause it does not match any of the terms

    <Title>Feature request: Split Search &amp; Explorer side bars, Allow more than one row for 'Open Tabs'</Title>
    <Description>Hi please if you could allow the 'Explorer' side bar be to the right of the editor and the 'Search' side bar be to the left of the editor it would be really nice and cool. I constantly use both of them and it's pretty annoying I can only have 1 of them at the same time.

Also if you could please add more flexibility to the Open Tabs section on top of the editor - to allow more than 1 row for all open files to fit in one screen. Because the horizontal scroll for open tabs is very unfriendly and annoying and it's very easy to miss-click.

Thank you very much,

Hi,
I use dark theme like "Monokai" and I have idea to redesign top toolbar.

# Current toolbar:
![image_109](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5067331/33070174-61955296-cecc-11e7-8853-dca2e9b9270d.png)

# Idea 1:
This is good because line of (File, Edit, Selection &amp; ...) move to top.
Top color change from blue to dark.
![demo-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5067331/33070249-a6e410bc-cecc-11e7-8ebe-44c64996a564.jpg)

    <Title>Launching multiple debugger sessions</Title>
    <Description>Actually I have a workspace with multiple folders. For debugging my application, I need to start an API and my Website via grunt tasks. Now I want to start the debug-session with the launch.json and compound config:

launch.json for website:
```js
{
    // Verwendet IntelliSense zum Ermitteln möglicher Attribute.
    // Zeigen Sie auf vorhandene Attribute, um die zugehörigen Beschreibungen anzuzeigen.
    // Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Site",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "url": "http://localhost:82/landing",
            "sourceMaps": false,
            "webRoot": "/www",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--remote-debugging-port=9222"
            ],
            "preLaunchTask": "grunt: serve"
        }
    ]
}
```

launch.json for api:

```js
{
    // Verwendet IntelliSense zum Ermitteln möglicher Attribute.
    // Zeigen Sie auf vorhandene Attribute, um die zugehörigen Beschreibungen anzuzeigen.
    // Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

        {
            "name": "Start API and XDebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9000,
            "preLaunchTask": "grunt: serve",
        }
    ]
}
```

For both I need to execute the grunt tasks "serve".
How can I achive a compound launch, whoch executes "preLaunchTasks" in different folders.

My workspace structur looks like this:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open any file with cpp code, e.g. a standard Makefile
2. zoom in and out
3. At zoom 0 the artefacts usually do not accure, at zoom -2 they do. 

Since the screen resolution is quite high, I need to set VS Code to zoom -2. You can see the error well in the picture attached, after "E" in $MAKE and also after "M". This artefacts seem to appear  at random positions.

    <Title>Additional API to access editor `when` state from extensions</Title>
    <Description>I'm working on a vscode extension that allows programming via voice. The design of the vscode api and commands is almost ideal, however it is vital that the voice control software knows the state of the editor.

Different phrases need to trigger different commands based on what part of the editor is in focus, whether or not the file is read only, etc. Essentially a ton of different checks that land up looking identical to the `when` clause in the key configurations. Unfortunately the logic to check which mode it is in needs to be available during sentence parsing since it can dramatically affect the context of the command being taken.

The ideal for me would be a `queryCurrentState()` function which returns a list of enabled states/flags (unsure of what they're called internally): `['editorHasSelection', 'editorTextFocus']`</Description>

Visual Studio Code should not make the .vscode dir in directories added to the project, when working in a workspace. The projects I work on often have multiple toolchains (3 to 5+ is quite common). I usually use a "./project_name/Toolchains" folder, common in these scenarios. Which means VSC lives in "./project_name/Toolchains/Visual Studio Code" in my structure, which means I want temporary VSC data there as well. Currently the .vscode dir is polluting my project root directory, which is not favorable. Toolchains should live in their project directory, not in the project root in my opinion.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. I have a workspace in "./project_name/Toolchains/Visual Studio Code/my-project.Test My Environment.code-workspace"
2. I added my project root ("./project_name") as folder to my workspace
3. I save something related to a project (folder/workspace/etc)
4. .vscode dir appears in ./project_name

The work space is split in two.
So, when you move the border between them, mini-map can cover 2-3 symbols of code, those which are the last in the most long lines.

![mini-map hides some code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/32999787-a53a5a44-cdac-11e7-84fa-934f2efc6f07.gif)

    <Title>feature request: open debug panel in bottom view instead of left view</Title>
    <Description>The debug view on the left is rather inconveniently sized for usage, it would be much more convenient to have an option to move it into the bottom panel (preferably having it visible along with Debug Console if possible).  Same goes for the Source Control panel.  Both are very inconvenient to use in the left view.

(if there's a way to move these already, please let me know)

    <Title>Setting based on file extension support</Title>
    <Description>Currently I want to disable javascript validation only on files that have an specific file extension,

For example I associate the extension **.js.test** to javascript using glob pattern like so
```
   "files.associations": {
        "*.js.test": "javascript"
    }
```
Now I want to disable javascript validation but not in all javascript files just on the ones that end with **.js.test** is there a way to do so?

I've seen other suggestions of implementations for this like
```
   "files.settings": {
        "*.js.test": {
             "javascript.validate.enable": false
         }
    }
```
but as far as I know, this is not possible at the moment. 

Is there a way to archive this without having to create a custom language extension?

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a folder with a hyphen in the name with at least one space from both sides. For example "C:\Test - TypeScript"
2. Create a typescript project inside and run a build task.
3.  The project does not compile:

After the selection is inserted into the document, the text cursor disappears. Pressing random keys doesn't change the document in any visible way. I have to mouse click in the document for the text cursor to reappear.

Using only the keyboard for making autocomplete selections works as expected: the text cursor is never lost.

Bug: vscode.workspace.textDocuments doesn't include the files listed under "Open Editors" until the file is activated the 1st time. Our extension wants to check if there are any C++ files open, even if they haven't been given focus yet.

According to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10304 it sounds like the docs in Open Editors should belong to textDocuments.

    <Title>Extension: Disable virtual file from reloading on refocus</Title>
    <Description>I have an extension, that opens a "Virtual File" (I think that is what it is called). The file has a input textbox and which when you type filters a table by showing/hiding rows. When you switch tabs, then come back to the virtual file, the input has been cleared and the table reloaded. 

Is there a way to make it so that the tab doesn't get reloaded when it is refocused?

Here is how I am initiating the creation of the virtual file:

```ts
    protected static async openVirtualFile(path: string, title: string, content: string) {
        let uri = Uri.parse('laravel-artisan://artisan/' + path);
        let doc = await workspace.openTextDocument(uri);
        let edit = new WorkspaceEdit();
        let range = new Range(0, 0, doc.lineCount, doc.getText().length);
        edit.set(uri, [new TextEdit(range, content)]);
        workspace.applyEdit(edit);
        commands.executeCommand('vscode.previewHtml', uri, ViewColumn.One, title);
    }

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.18.1
- OS Version: macOS 10.13.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Check 'Open folders in tabs instead of new windows' in Finder Preferences (if not set)
2. Open vscode
3. In preferences set `"window.nativeTabs": true` (restart vscode if needed)
4. Ensure the vscode tab bar is showing, click View-&gt; Show Tab Bar
5. Observe empty tab bar with no 'welcome' or `+` symbol on the right side

Image of empty tab bar:
&lt;img width="901" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 10 15 46 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13921582/32962254-a157f5b8-cb80-11e7-8daf-0fcca721ddbd.png"&gt;

6. Click the anywhere on the tab bar, observe a new window is opened
7. Observe only 1 window can be in the foreground at a time

However switching between 2 windows can still be done via the Window menu:
&lt;img width="223" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 10 20 43 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13921582/32962359-0656d3e4-cb81-11e7-97d3-368871125758.png"&gt;

Further to clicking on the empty tab bar, clicking File-&gt;New Window also opens a window with same behaviour (I believe this should open a tab with `window.nativeTabs:true`).

It's fine on Windows/Mac, but failing on Linux. I don't think the change that first got the fail ([here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/commit/96d39b28e61c83497cff8c9dc5af76176534eb49)) is the cause.</Description>

    <Title>Can‘t install extension without internet access anymore</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.1
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have no internet connection
2. Try to install an extension via command line (with `—install-extension`)

When you do this, you get an error like this:

```
code --install-extension vscode-icons.vsix
Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN marketplace.visualstudio.com:443
    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:1050:11)
    at errnoException (dns.js:33:15)
    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:73:26)
```

Extension doesn‘t seem to matter. I‘ve also verified that the extension doesn‘t get installed anyways.

Unfortunately, in my situation I do not have any internet connection.

This used to work with version 1.17.2.</Description>

    <Title>VS Code not closing after running extension tests on Linux</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.0
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ubuntu 14.04 VM (with Java 8)
2. clone `https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run compile`
5. `cd packages/salesforcedx-vscode-core/`
6. `npm run test`

We are running a Travis CI build for testing our extension and recently started noticing failing builds on Linux. After a failing test, the VS Code window executing the test does not close. This makes the test script hung/stuck. Eventually it gets killed by Travis because of lack of output.

I've setup a local Ubuntu 14.04 VM and I'm able to reproducing the issue. The VS Code windows is not closed and test execution gets stuck. When I close the window manually, test execution continues and the following output is logged:
`Tests exited with code: 0`

This seems to happen only on Linux. I'm unable to reproduce on macOS and Windows. The tests finish successful on macOS and Windows. Thus, I'm suspecting something specific to the Linux environment.

For completeness, here is the log output:
```
 npm run test

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code
2. Create PHP document
3. Type a closing html bracket character (greater than &gt; ).
4. It suggests (autocomplete) `$_COOKIE` so while typing a new HTML tag in a PHP file, if you press return after the first tag, you get: `&lt;div&gt;$_COOKIE.`

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;
Reproduces without extensions: Yes

It should instead of offering `$_COOKIE` for auto complete, most of the time add a closing HTML element. The editor handles JS inside HTML fine in this regard. PHP should work as nicely.</Description>

    <Title>iOS</Title>
    <Description>I realize that this has been mentioned in the past and may not be the most appropriate channel, but I am hopeful that this post might start a dialogue and raise the request again. As a long time developer (21 years) who uses Windows, MacOS and Linux daily, vscode has become my primary editor on each of those platforms when I'm in a GUI. I'm regularly using or testing on Android and iOS devices and over the past couple years, an ipad pro has become my primary on the go device. I typically vpn/rdp when I need to do mobile development or heavy lifting that are beyond the current limitations of a mobile os / applications. Having said all that, vscode on iOS/Android would be a godsend and a game changer. I would gladly throw money at it. My deepest and most sincere thanks to everyone who has made vscode happen. Thank you!</Description>

I don't think this is actually a bug, just a small improvement on UX.

If you are working on a VSCode window that has the integrated terminal visible and change focus to another app window, if you try to return to VSCode's integrated terminal by clicking on it, it will set the focus to the editor if it was the last selected pane before VSCode lost focus the first time.

By other words, focus is returned in the VSCode app to the last used pane, instead of the one you actually click, ie, the integrated terminal.

It would be nice if the clicked pane became the selected one when window focus was returned to VSCode by clicking.</Description>

    <Title>Markdown editing experience</Title>
    <Description>Currently the Markdown editing experience works in a way that whenever I open a new .md file it would open it separately even if I already have a .md file opened and preview turned on. 

It would then open a new preview window to the side whenever the preview is requested.

A better experience would be to share preview pane across .md files I'm currently editing - when I switch to editing another file the MD preview would sync and (automatically) show the preview of the file I switched to.

The attached screenshot demonstrates the problem. I'm was editing configuration.md and switched to deployment.md and the preview did not update/sync accordingly.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. When I try to remove an existing breakpoint by clicking on the red circle in my code the red marker is not removed from the code line.
2. However the breakpoint is actually removed in the list of breakpoints. So it seems like this is only a graphics update error and that breakpoints work.

    <Title>Cannot fold code block with different style comments</Title>
    <Description>For I use other editor do some special tasks, the double slash is from the first one in each row when I use ***Comment shortcut***. But this comment sytle is not same with VSCode.

So, if I want fold the code block with these comments, I must comment these comments again and again in VSCode.

Just look at the pictures below:

    <Title>Create a global extension list</Title>
    <Description>Hey!

This is not an issue actually, more like a proposal.

Example:
I have a home machine where I have VS Code with several plugins that I always use. At work I have another machine with VS Code installed. And I have to install those plugins again.

It would be great to have an (optional) account with login/password which will store a list of extensions somewhere and when I install VSC to a new machine all extensions will be installed automatically. When installing a new extension you could introduce an option like 'Store to extension pull' or 'Try without adding' in case a user wants to play around with it and not to store it in extensions list.</Description>

    <Title>Font rendering issue in all panels</Title>
    <Description>I have noticed this issue with one of the 1.17.x versions earlier last month. I figured this will just go away after updating to the next version automatically. However, the issue still persists. Noto Mono (replacement for Droid Sans Mono on Debian) was the font set in user settings when I first noticed this issue. I changed it to a few other fonts and could reproduce it with them as well. I have also noticed that the issue is less prominent on certain color themes which have italics or bold characters. Also, this is reproducible for all font sizes.

![screenshot from 2017-11-13 23-57-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1550696/32742996-17e4efd6-c8d1-11e7-81f3-924caa04738f.png)

Font on the screenshot is plain `monospace`. Similar behavior can be noticed with other themes as mentioned. In case, it is not clear what I mean, check the lines 16, 19, 23 or near the import keyword at the top.

The only warning that is showing up in the dev console is shown in the screenshot.

I have the following config: 

```
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/*.js": { "when": "$(basename).ts" },
    "**/*.js.map": true
  }
```

And it seems to be case-sensitive on Windows.  Thus, I have class files like "MyClass.ts" compiled by `tsc` to `myclass.js` which breaks the file exclusion.  This makes me have to resort to using `"**/*.js": true`, which is not ideal, but works for now.</Description>

    <Title>Launch configs: resolve replacement patterns in object keys, in addition to values</Title>
    <Description>From https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/issues/226

A chrome-debug config can have

```
            "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
                "webpack:///C:/Depot/Impakt/DNA/DNACore/*": "${webRoot}/*" // SUCCEEDS
                //"webpack:///${workspaceRoot}/*": "${webRoot}/*" // FAILS
                //"webpack:///${webRoot}/*": "${webRoot}/*"  // FAILS
            },   
```

vscode replaces `${workspaceRoot}` in values, and the adapter replaces `${webRoot}` in values, and now after https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/pull/543, in keys as well. It would be great if vscode would replace `${workspaceRoot}` in keys.

One issue is that you can have collisions where two keys are the same after applying these replacements. In chrome-debug now, the last one wins where "last" is technically undefined.</Description>

    <Title>Auto Import path is broken</Title>
    <Description>Just installed VSCode on a new Mac a month ago and this auto import issue has been a problem every since. I cannot find a way to fix and it's about to drive me back to WebStorm.

I am using Typescript and Angular, when I enter a component class name in code I get the req underline if that class has not been imported, if I select the text I get the bulb icon to the left and it offers to import the missing class but the path is wrong as well as it's using double quotes when my config says to use single quotes. 

the path I am seeing is "src/app/folder/subfolder/component.name"

So what do I need to do to fix this problem?</Description>

    <Title>Typescript build task fails if path to local tsc contains spaces</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.0 (public)
- OS Version: macOS 10.13.1 (High Sierra)
- Reproduces without extensions: Yes

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a ${workspaceRoot} in something like `/Users/me/dev folder/project/`
2. Install a local version of tsc using `npm i typescript --save-dev`
3. Configure the default typescript build task (using the `tsc: build - tsconfig.json` preset)
4. It will generate the following:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "typescript",
            "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$tsc"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
5. If you run the build task, it will generate the following error:
```
&gt; Executing task: /Users/me/dev folder/project/node_modules/.bin/tsc -p "/Users/me/dev folder/project/tsconfig.json" &lt;

/bin/bash: /Users/me/dev: No such file or directory
The terminal process terminated with exit code: 127

Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.
```

If I replicate the task manually, using the following
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "'${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/tsc'",
            "args": [
                "-p",
                "'${workspaceRoot}/tsconfig.json'"
            ],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$tsc"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
}
```

Read message that tells me it updated itself. Thanks

Now I have breakpoints added all over the place in my code and Remove all breakpoints does nothing.
When I run Debug I get Error: Set breakpoints request timed out
presumably because there are so many of them.

How do I remove them, click on them, Remove All Breakpoints, does nothing.

    <Title>Editing files with breakpoints is completely broken</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18.0
- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04 x64

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add multiple breakpoints to a file
2. Edit the file in between the breakpoints.

No extensions are enabled.
When editing the file by inserting new lines between existing breakpoints, more and more breakpoints are added - some valid, some not. Most of the breakpoint decorations cannot be removed by clicking on them - the file must be closed and reopened to clear them.

Set 3 breakpoints:

Add and delete some new (empty) lines between the breakpoints and I end up with this:

The extra breakpoints are stuck - they cannot be deleted by clicking on them.
A little more for your entertainment...

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a file deep in a folder hierarchy.
2. Open and close the file. It creates an entry for the same in VSCode 'recent open' list
3. In the list, you would see the path is long so we don't see file names. Hard to pick if we don't see the file names. Expectation is, to see filename always &amp; show full blown path on mouse hover or in some other way.

    <Title>Have option to persist split editor</Title>
    <Description>When I work on code, I most often have my editor split into two columns. VSCode is a wonderful IDE but I believe that the split editor functionality could use a little love.

To split the editor to begin with, you must have a file open, then click the "split editor" button. This will give you 2 columns with the same file open in both. Not that big of a deal except that I don't typically want to have the same file open in both columns. When I close the file, it closes the column, so I have to open the file I want in that column first, then close the original file so that I have different files open in each column. That is a lot of steps that I must take to do so.

What I would love is 2 new config options:

- An option to not close a column when the last file is closed within it.
- An option to start with the editor split into a given number of columns.

This would make working with split editors much better in my opinion.

Thank you for the great work and wonderful program. I do greatly enjoy working in VSCode and it has become my editor of choice.</Description>

    <Title>Add command to open raw settings file.</Title>
    <Description>Opening the settings forces VS Code to use that settings editor view, which has the default settings on one side and the user's file on the other. Often i do not need or want that.

If i just want to find anything in my settings file, the results start in the default settings, which i do not care about. Also, the additional split view takes a lot of space. If my panel setup already has some splits there is near to no space left for my settings file and the default settings cannot be hidden completely.

It would be nice to have the alternative open-file-command, similar to the keyboard shortcuts:

There are many great ways to search for a specific file or for searching for files within a folder, but no current ways to search for a folder itself and then open that in the explorer panel.

I'm constantly doing the "long scroll" through my node_modules folder whenever I want to dive into some source code and can't imagine I'm the only one. This would be crazy helpful.

    <Title>FR: Prevent code lens from shifting cursor position</Title>
    <Description>I think usability wise, the current state of code lens is very disorienting, and I tend to disable them across the extensions I use.

The main reason I do so is that they're constantly messing with my "visual" cursor position. Every time I switch to a new file that has code lens, or the code lens appear, it's very disorienting for my cursor to suddenly jump down 2-3 lines.

I think that I'd prefer if the codelens instead were displayed in a manner that prevented the cursor position from shifting. So, for example, instead of 
```
------------------
foo
|bar
fun
------------------
```
turning into 
```
------------------
foo
CODELENS
|bar
------------------
```
it would turn into
```
------------------
CODELENS
|bar
fun
------------------

Steps to Reproduce:

1. When you have a large list of folders in Explorer that requires scrolling and you're trying to create a new folder in ROOT directory and have any folder selected, it's impossible to create a folder from within an application.  When clicking Add new folder from explorer toolbar that appears on mouseover explorer header it creates a folder in a selected folder and it's impossible to deselect a folder.  Make same menu appear on mouseover of subdirectories of a parent or allow margin space on the bottom of a list where click is possible to deselect a folder or right click to deselect a folder.

2. It appears that you can click Collapse All or Refresh to deselect a folder but it's too confusing and not intuitive.

I add a breakpoint on any line and after debugging for a while I can't remove such breakpoints, they are "ghosts" they show up but they are not really there. If I restart VS code the breakpoint goes away, I add it again run without changing any code and sometimes the breakpoint is not hit. one time its hit the next one it is not.

I don't really know how to reproduce but it is happening to me very frequently.

- VSCode Version: 1.18 , node 7.9
- OS Version: Win 10

Steps to Reproduce:
 
I have a very large javascript file (this allows me to import Json, since direct import is not supported in es6. There are 328K lines in the file. There is nothing wrong with syntax. but the text is all white, not colored, and the right-click context menu has no option for format. The JS icon does appear in the Exlplorer. The file name is Run-1-0.js

When I first entered the data, syntax highlighting worked, I restarted VSCODE and it was lost.

The data in the file looks like the following (15K repetitions are not included here:

```
export {data, metaData}

const metaData = {
    color: {
        rgba: [255, 255, 0, 255]

    title: "Scene 2, Run 0"

    <Title>No API for closing inactive TextEditors</Title>
    <Description>Looking at the docs for TextEditor (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#TextEditor) the Hide method has been deprecated. Per the documentation, its replacement is `workbench.action.closeActiveEditor`, which only closes the currently visible TextEditor tab.

There is (apparently) no supported way to close inactive TextEditors. Would it be possible to add such an API back?

(User scenario:
Omnisharp-Roslyn is adding support for CodeActions that rename files. When a file is renamed on disk, that's open in VS Code, Code keeps open the tab for the old file name but adds "Deleted" to the tab title. Omnisharp-Roslyn would like to close editor for renamed files. With the current APIs, there's no good way for us to close files that get renamed unless they are the active editor)</Description>

it would be awesome if we can get a Feature like Visual Studio/Webstorm has. 
js/map and css Files should be inside the ts and scss files. 

Is there something planned or a plugin for that?

    <Title>Central storage of settings</Title>
    <Description>This is not an issue but a request.

What I would like to see is a central storage for all user settings.  As a developer I work on multiple workstations.  With that VSCode is my go to app.

What I would imagine is a login system to my Microsoft account (settings stored in OneDrive) and whenever I would log into my account on another system my settings would come with me.

These settings would include how I run my spacing's, all the way up to how I like my UI laid out.

I could understand that some settings would not be transferred such as extensions, but having a list of "liked" extensions would also be nice so if I need to install them then I can.

Having these settings stored in something like one drive would also allow for me to directly edit them if needed or even copy my settings and email them to a friend.

Thank you for your time and the product is great.  Use it every day.

- VSCode Version: 1.18.0
- OS Version: lubuntu 17.10
hi. I just installed vscode 1.18 on my fresh lubuntu 17.10 desktop. I notice that after I click sublime or others on the welcome page to import keyboard shortcuts. It is still highlighted blue. which should highlighted as gray on previous version. Is this expected now on the current version? If so I think it sucks because it can't determine the imported tools or language on welcome page (specially me I didn't hide welcome page and always check that thing on the right side).

It needs to be fixed or is there a trick to do what I expected?

Steps to Reproduce:

1. install new vscode
2. click sublime on `install keyboard shortcuts`
3. click php, javascript, typescript on `Tools and languages`

    <Title>[ Feature Request ] Multi-screen same workspace Drag and Drop Tabs outside the vscode window</Title>
    <Description>Hi Vscode Team!

In my opinion, the next step for VScode is to allow the use of multiple screens within the same workspace. Just as IntelliJ does.

The ability to drag an editor tab outside the VScode window, and then drop it to spawn a new editor pane, free to resize and move independently, would be a major improvement in term of ergonomy and confort.

We already have the possibility to open our working folder twice, but this feature would allow to keep the same state. The breakpoints could be seen on the two windows etc..

Do you think this is doable ?
Does electron allow the spawn of children views ?

Do you think VScode will one day or another implement this feature ?

Thanks for your response :)</Description>

    <Title>Scroll position is not being preserved when switching between tabs with OmniSharp Intellisense working</Title>
    <Description>VS code version 1.18

When switching between tabs the scroll position of each tab is changing. Cursor position stays correct.

Type of files: c# . "OmniSharp Intellisense"  is enabled. 

How to reproduce:
open several c# files with at least 3 full page scrolls each, have  "OmniSharp Intellisense" extension enabled(you should see reference injections appear)  and switch between files using ether tabs on top or picking files from "open editors". You will see scroll position will change on each switch.  

My guess:
Some funky thing going on during Omnisharp Intellisense reference injection. See screenshot

This isn't 100% reproducible but the breakpoint indicators seem to very often get out of sync with the actual breakpoints. You can see this below -- where I have no breakpoints, but indicators all over. I am also seeing issues where toggling a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter doesn't work all the time either, sometimes it adds the indicator without adding the actual breakpoint, others it adds the breakpoint with no indicator.

Also to get the problem to go away, I usually have to completely restart vscode.

    <Title>Can extensions override default configurations other than editor configurations?</Title>
    <Description>There is contribution point `configurationDefaults` to override default configurations, but configurations which can be overridden are limited to those about editor configurations. Is there a way for extensions to override default configurations other than editor configurations?

### Background

I used extension [vscode-standardjs](https://github.com/chenxsan/vscode-standardjs), which lints and formats JavaScript codes according to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard), and made built-in JavaScript formatter run on typing (set `editor.formatOnType` to `true`). And I came across a problem about on-type formatting because some default formatting configurations are not appropriate for JavaScript Standard Style (chenxsan/vscode-standardjs#47).

This problem can be avoided by manually overriding default formatter configurations in `settings.json`, but it would be helpful if vscode-standardjs can override default configurations like this:

```
    "configurationDefaults": {
      "[javascript]": {
        "javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterConstructor": true,
        "javascript.format.insertSpaceBeforeFunctionParenthesis": true
      }
    }
```

    <Title>Cant re-run grunt tasks since v1.18</Title>
    <Description>I just upgraded to v1.18 and can no longer re-run a grunt task. This problem did not exist prior to this version. 

The issue only exists if you try to run the same grunt task again, i.e I can run 'task1' once and if I try to run again I cannot but I can run 'task2' but then can't run 'task2' again.

- VSCode Version: 1.18
- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run a grunt task, in this case I'm running one of my grunt tasks called 'cleanAll' which cleans up some folders. This problem exists for any of my grunt tasks though.

2. The task runs correctly in the terminal as below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11023398/32644517-da79e1e2-c646-11e7-9a55-3beb98637aa3.png)

3. If I then try to rerun the same grunt task using the above steps 1-2 I get the below message

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11023398/32644548-0876f5da-c647-11e7-906b-eff0d1cd4edd.png)

4. If I then click 'Kill Terminal' I get the below assertion failure

Some of the extensions provide additional panels in the explorer. This is how my new VSCode window looks now:

The problem I'm having is that I have a docker extension installed only for syntax highlighting, but it forces its panel everywhere, and I have to turn it manually in each window. I'd like to see something like "Disable Always".

The other problem is that it's not possible to go from a panel to whatever extension provides it. Notice how I have two outlines: one is "Code Outline" coming from a good functional extension, the other is "Code outline" and i couldn't yet figure where did I get that one. Something like "Show Extension" in the context menu would help a lot to track those.</Description>

- OS Version: Windows 10 16299.19 and Mac OS 10.13.1
Reproduces without extensions: To show the issue,  I have to launch my program.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add breakpoints before debugging
2. The issues mostly happens when deleting breakpoints when the program stops at any breakpoints. Deleting breakpoints when the program is not running sometimes trigger this issues.

It also deletes one of the other breakpoints( mostly next line). Usually for my Windows. 
The breakpoints are deleted and program no longer stops there. But the dots are still shown. Usually for my Mac, sometimes for my Windows.

When I restart VSCode, the dots are not showing any more.

The points are still shown with no breakpoint on the left side
The issues happens on both C++ and Java, so it shouldn't be the problem of extensions.

Dear Vs Code Team, 

This issue has been opened since version 1.17.0 on High Sierra as well as have discussed so much at the community, to solve Native Tab issue by myself, I have prepared my own electron build (on MacOs High Sierra), follow this instructions https://electron.atom.io/docs/development/build-instructions-osx/ and works great with Native Tabs again but with some issues, for example "cannot check updates" etc You have improved electron for code, How can I find your own electron implementations, Can you share with me and with community? 

Thanks,

    <Title>Add when context: editorGroupIndex</Title>
    <Description>It would be great if it where possible to use the editor group index/id in keybinding when clauses.

This would provide location context aware key commands for editorGroup/pane navigation.

Example
```
 { "key": "ctrl+h",             "command": "workbench.action.focusPreviousGroup" 
                                              "when": "editorGroupIndex != 0" },
 { "key": "ctrl+h",             "command": "workbench.files.action.focusFilesExplorer",
                                              "when": "editorGroupIndex == 0" },
```
In this case an editorGroupCount would probably also be necessary for determining if you are in the last editorGroup.

An alternative would be firstEditorGroup/lastEditorGroup, since I think most navigation rules would happen at the edges, and not in the middle of several open editor groups.

Is it possible to add where clauses in an extension, or would this functionality only be accessible after a vs code application change?

I would also be interested in submitting a PR for this, but not sure where to start in the code base.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Execute a search in the search viewlet.
2. I have ~42 results in 12 files.
3. **Open the SCM viewlet**
4. Open one of the files where there is a search result
5. Edit the file such that you add a new search result or that you remove a search result by editing

**Important** because this was so bad that I had to stop what I was doing and check what the hell is causing VS Code to stutter.

&gt; Observe typing/working is perturbed by the search viewlet (which is not visible!). This is all on a quite fast machine

 * first one is 133ms blocked
 * second one is 142ms blocked
 * third one is 320ms blocked

In any case, removing one more result or adding one more result shouldn't take over 10ms.

    <Title>Allow sharing of task environments</Title>
    <Description>Various tasks need environment variable set up to work properly. Currently a task can use the "tasks/options/env" property to define additional variables per task.

However, you may have many different tasks, and all of them need the same environment. It is cumbersome to duplicate this in every single task. It would be nice if there was a syntax to inherit this somehow.

For a simple example of where this would be useful, consider the case of defining tasks for running CMake in various configurations (debug, release, x86, x64) against an MSVC toolchain.  In order for this to work, each of these will need to set up a vcvars-like environment of include paths, lib paths, etc.  The path to the headers is always going to be the same, and the path to the lbiraries will always be the same for x86 (across debug &amp; release), and will always be the same for x64 (across debug &amp; release).

So we should be able to define a single include environment, and 2 lib environments, and then when we define the tasks for each of the cmake configurations, simply import the two previously defined environments.

The alternative is to copy a huge mess of variables into every single task, which is pretty cumbersome.</Description>

    <Title>Clicking on filenames in terminal does not work when line is wrapped</Title>
    <Description>I wondered for a while why sometimes ctrl+clicking on a filename in the console doesn't open the file. I just noticed it is failing when text is wrapped. This is for a build task which has an exception I want to investigate.

For example I see the error:
    at SomeDataAccessMongo.module.exports.SomeDataAccessMongo.processCriteria (c:\work\project1\project1\something\db\some-dao-mon
go.js:43:27)

Notice the line break put in between some-dao-mon and go.js

Yes I don't have a very wide screen and this error line is crazy long.. but if I press ctrl+b to close the side panel it the console text is not re-wrapped. So I cant click on it and I cant see any way to configure the console to have scrollbars, etc unless I restart the build task with the side panel closed. After which I can see the full error text on one line and can click it fine.

    <Title>Using jsconfig.json and custom .d.ts file with non js extensions</Title>
    <Description>Hello!

I have a JSConfig.json file in my working directory containing the following:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "checkJs": true,
        "lib": ["es6"]
    }
}
```

I also have a custom 'globals.d.ts' file which contains the data I want for the autocomplete options. This works perfectly for .js file extensions, but it seems to ignore it for custom file extensions I associated with the javascript language. The extensions added to the settings like this:
"files.associations": {
        "*.sample": "javascript"
    },

Should also use these files. 

At the moment, the custom file extensions I have just use the standard es6 library for Autocomplete, rather than the file in my working directory (which .js files use).

Would be nice if we can save query state in keyboard shortcuts tab.

So I'm using a **surface laptop**, upgraded it of course to the pro while I could for free.
I'm having issues with scrolling up and down on VSCode. It's not smooth at all.
This is mainly with the _track pad_.
I scroll up and it takes a few seconds for VSCode to register that I want to scroll up and it just jumps.

I have opened up other apps (slack, edge, chrome, office word, VS) and the scrolling behaves just fine and it's very responsive. Not sure why VSCode has a hard time since it's just an advanced text editor.

What is super interesting is that, when I use the touch SCREEN (not the track pad) scrolling is fine.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Two fingers on track pad
2. move them up and/or down

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup task in tasks.json with $eslint-stylish problem matcher
2. Files to check with eslint should generate errors large enough (larger than terminal width). For example use big font size, long errors names and long errors descriptions.
![terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012334/32404828-a7d4e354-c169-11e7-8139-1eef2cfef586.PNG)
3. Problem matcher recognise wrapped part of error message as a file name.
![warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012334/32404851-43d98e76-c16a-11e7-8e9c-74bfb4bd1dbf.PNG)
4. Click on such warning leads to error

    <Title>Font "ripping"/aliasing on ubuntu 16.04 with 1.17.2</Title>
    <Description>After updating from 1.17.1 to 1.17.2, I'm seeing some very bad aliasing/artifacts in the code window (all fonts affected):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1351158/32399965-f26e2c7a-c0b7-11e7-93a5-6bbe05433e2a.png)
(notice especially on the settings pane, e.g. font for setting "ruby.rctComplete.commandPath" has strange artifacts between the characters)

Note - this problem was not present until just now, when I opened the code editor after it auto-updated to 1.17.2. That said, it's possible something on my machine is causing issues, so I'll continue to debug as I have time and report back. Any ideas of what to test/check are welcome. Finally, apologies if this is a dupe, but I couldn't find any reports similar to this.

    <Title>Tab/keys navigation in Search panel</Title>
    <Description>When searching for a file using keyboard controls, you can use Shift+Ctrl+F to switch to the `Search` panel.

- Entering a search text, then pressing `Tab` should navigate to the next text input, which is "include files" . Instead it will first tabstop on various buttons, so you have to Tab 5 times or use mouse to click the include files input.

- It would be nice if pressing `Esc` while focused on any of the inputs would return to the Explorer panel. The rationale behind that is that in many IDEs "Search in files" is a popup window which can be closed with Esc to return back to normal edition.

    <Title>File explorer not working at all</Title>

For example when I type `console.`  I get the full list of console member functions sorted alphabetically even though 99% of the time I end up choosing `log`. After some period of use the `log` member function should appear at the top, perhaps in a "frequently used" area.</Description>

    <Title>[typescript] Syntax highlighting fails after ++ &lt; characters</Title>

Steps to Reproduce:

![bad-parsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3863014/32331368-9586dd6e-bfda-11e7-8a3d-197c407cf540.gif)

Type the following code in a blank TypeScript file:
```javascript
let a = 0;
a++ &lt; 0;
let b = 0;
```
All syntax highlighting for lines following the `++ &lt;` characters is corrupted (for example, in the GIF above, the `let` keyword has the wrong colour). The following expressions are fine:
```javascript
(a++) &lt; 0
a++ &lt;= 0
a++ &gt; 0
++a &lt; 0
```
The issue does not occur when JavasScript syntax highlighting is used.

open random typescript file in same editor with is not in `/src/**` folder and has syntax error in it.
vscode will correctly show problems in opened file
start debugger session - this popup message appears:
`Build errors have been detected during preLaunchTask 'npm: watch'. [Debug Anyway] [Show problems] [Cancel]`
but there is not errors in terminal panel `Task - watch` (because errors are in file not relevant to tsc) so i think, that error message should not be shown ...</Description>

I wanna disable emmet and beautifiers, prettifiers when i'm in `["makefile"]` buffer, but for now only editor settings are available to customize.

2. too long delay to display the task list
3. maybe we could display the recently used tasks imediately and load the rest
4. task is changed according to some json change or ...? maybe we could refresh the task list at different moments rather than activating.

    <Title>File paths in build output and terminal only autodetect when terminal has scrolled.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.18.0-insider (1.18.0-insider)
- OS Version: macOS 10.13.2 beta

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a project window.
2. open the integrated terminal.
3. `mkdir some_dir` (or use an existing dir with a source file in it).
4. `touch some_dir/some_file.txt` (or use existing).
5. Mouse over the file path (either the typed command or the output). It will not highlight.
6. Now press enter until the terminal scrolls, and then scroll back and try again.
7. Once the terminal has scrolled, then the paths will be recognized, showing an underline and tooltip "cmd+click to follow link" on mouseover. 

Path recognition in the terminal is a fabulous feature (it makes VSCode an IDE for any script that prints `path:line:col` messages), and it is a shame that it is broken for this common case!

    <Title>In the 'Extensions' View, only the two first entries of the 'INSTALLED' category are visible by default, and the separator's position is not remembered</Title>

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.17.2 x64
- OS Version: win10 x64

Steps to Reproduce:

1. When clicking to expand the 'Extensions' View (Ctrl+Shift+X)
then, no matter how many extensions you have, it only show the first 2 of them. *(and immediately below them, are the "RECOMMENDED" category entries)* 
In my case I have 5, as seen in the counter:
![2017-11-01_220526](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/723651/32295809-05333e42-bf53-11e7-82bf-785e87cc234a.jpg)

2. Even if you drag the the "RECOMMENDED" category separator lower, in order to make all extension entries visible,
then, if you close the View and re-open it, it will have 2 extension entries visible only, again.

My suggestion:

- either either make sure that in the 'INSTALLED' category entries appear as many as possible, i.e. have the separator's position maybe to the 3/4 of the display's height by default
- or just store the position of the separator, when the user moves it.

    <Title>`addWorkspaceFolder` / `removeWorkspaceFolder` are not effective API</Title>
    <Description>Testing #37133

fyi @jrieken . 

---

* observe that a WorkspaceFolder has three fields: `uri`, `name` and `index`.
* observe the reading API: `export let workspaceFolders: WorkspaceFolder[] | undefined;`

---

IMHO, the editing API seems out of place:
* `removeWorkspaceFolder` takes as argument a single `WorkspaceFolder`; why a single one ?
* `addWorkspaceFolder` also takes in a single `WorkspaceFolder`; why ? It also ignores the `index` property; how to add something at the beginning of the array ?

e.g. of difficulty:
* how to implement replace folder at `i` with another folder. i.e. `workspaceFolders[i] = newWorkspaceFolder`:
    * remove N folders where folder.index &gt;= i, i.e. call `removeWorkspaceFolder` N times
    * add N folders back again i.e. call `addWorkspaceFolder` N times 

IMHO a much simpler API would be a `setWorkspaceFolders(newWorkspaceFolders: WorkspaceFolder[])`</Description>

    <Title>Terminal does not warp lines dynamically</Title>
    <Description>Refs: #37149
OS: Ubuntu

I found this while following the test plan item, though you are probably aware of this limitation.
1. Open terminal, do a `ls`
2. Resize the window by decreasing size -&gt; temrinal does not wrap lines on resize
3. If I do a `ls` once the window is smaller all lines get nicely wrapped

I would expect that terminal nicely wraps lines once I reduce the size of the window.
Sorry if duplicate

    <Title>Panel seems to overlap to the sidebar when sidebar is right</Title>
    <Description>Testing: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/36906

Steps to Reproduce:

1. put the sidebar to the right
2. put the panel vertically

It looks like some pixels of the panel overlap into the sidebar (see the scrollbar):

    <Title>TS autoimport should provide qualification to make imported entries unique</Title>
    <Description>Testing: #37177 

- JS project
- file provide1.js
```js
export function foo() {

export function foo1() {

- file provide2.js
```js
export function foo() {

export function foo2() {

- inside body bar type foo1, select the symbol. Notice import generated correctly
- inside body bar type foo2, select the symbol. Notice import generated correctly
- inside body bar type foo

Observe:
- there is only one foo
- IMO there should be two, each qualified with the file exporting it
- select foo
- an import is added. I couldn't come up with a rule which on is taken.

    <Title>search.useIgnoreFilesByDefault should explain in description that this is used for quick open</Title>
    <Description>Refs: #37179

Currently useIgnoreFilesByDefault never mentions that this is actually used for quick open. From the description the user would get a feeling that this is only used for search viewlet.
I propose to update the description and clarify that this setting is for quick pick.

Also why the phrase "new workspace"?

    <Title>Feature Request: Flat View for Project Folder panel</Title>
    <Description>Currently, VSCode displays the project folder panel in a hierarchical way, like this:

1. Root
    1. app
        1. components
        2. controllers
    2. test
        1. unittest
        2. integrationtest

Coming from other IDEs (and being a person who is fond of fine-grained package structures), I would much rather have a "flattened" view instead of a nested tree:

- Root
    - files
- root.app
    - files
- root.app.components
    - files
- root.app.components.controllers
    - files
- root.test.unittest
    - files
- root.test.integrationtest
    - files

Additionally, if "root.app" doesn't contain files itself (only contains sub-folders), then hiding the entry alltogether would be nice too.

Sorry if this already exists in VSCode, but if it does, then I didn't find it.</Description>

    <Title>Is it Possible to add live collaborative editing?</Title>
    <Description>Something like this would be very cool.

Say, I want to get other people to work with me on a project, live... no github etc. 
Think Google docs, where multiple people can start typing on the same page.

I'm a host, and I share my url through slack. 

My friend gets the url, clicks it and it opens up vscode on his side.

And now his Vscode is directly connected to my workfolder.

- He can bring files his files into my workspace by drag and drop into sidebar, which actually copies file into my computer.
- He can run terminal commands in his vscode terminal, and  they run on my computer. 
- He can run browser within vscode and go to localhost, which works because VScode is sort of like virtual desktop connected to him via P2P, and i can see him as scroll and click things as if it was me.
- If we both are editing same file, then his cursor is visible in my file and it live updates the file as does mine on his side.
- if person is editing a different file, then on sidebar file gets highlighted by color of person editing it
- voice chat


If this can be done, It'd be possible to Pair Program like never before. Not even for remote purposes. Just sitting across the table working on one codebase.

It'd be revolutionary and awesome. 

Please add this feature.

    <Title>decreaseIndentPattern and autocomplete cause autocomplete to replace word incorrectly</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.17.2 b813d12980308015bcd2b3a2f6efa5c810c33ba5 2017-10-16T13:43:44.213Z
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.6

There seems to be a race condition with decreaseIndentPattern and autocomplete where the autocomplete window doesn't close when typing the next character.

### Example script used with steps
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func do(i interface{}) {
	switch v := i.(type) {
	case int:
		fmt.Printf("Twice %v is %v\n", v, v*2)
	case string:
		fmt.Printf("%q is %v bytes long\n", v, len(v))
	default:
		fmt.Printf("I don't know about type %T!\n", v)
	}
}

func main() {
	do(21)
	do("hello")
	do(true)
}
```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to Ln 6, Col 27 located at the end of line 6 `switch v := i.(type) {`
2. hit enter
    - Cursor should go to Ln 7, Col 9
3. type `case float64:`
    - make sure to type everything out without using autocomplete
    - as `:` is typed, `decreaseIndentPattern` should kick in and move the line left 1 tab
    - the cursor now moves, but vscode still displays the autocomplete for `float64'
4. hit enter
    - vscode replaces `loat64:` with `float64` and the line looks like `case ffloat64`

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Roll mouse pointer over the top horizontal scrollbar under the tabs
2. (a) Scrollbar is too narrow to be useful
    (b) It's really annoying when tabs on the left scroll out of view ... the most important file usually goes there.  So you want to get back to it, you can't see it and then have to deal with the annoying scroll bar.  
Liked the old VS way of handling this better.

    <Title>Default Settings tab: scroll and opened section lost after activating another tab</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.17.1 (1e9d36539b0ae51ac09b9d4673ebea4e447e5353, 2017-10-10T14:24:50.851Z)

The Default Settings scroll (and opened section) lost after activating another tab.
Thanks in advance and regards,
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some files
2. Open the Default Settings (Ctrl+Comma), scroll down and open a section.
3. Activate another tab.
4. Activate the Default Settings tab and you can notice that the scroll is lost (you are at the top) and the opened section is closed (the first one is opened).</Description>

- VSCode Version: 1.16.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have a tasks.json with reveal set to silent or never.
2. Ctrl+Shift+B on file that has an error (matched by error matcher).
3. My program doesn't launch as expected, I sit there wondering for a few seconds why, until I see there is 1 error in the status bar.
4. I have to press F8 to go to where the error is.

I'd like a setting (in tasks.json or elsewhere) that automates steps 3 &amp; 4, such that if a task matches an error, I am instantly brought to it, saving me seconds each time it happens.

    <Title>Support `args` in contributed keybindings</Title>
    <Description>If you insert the following Codeblock to keybindings.json everything works fine:
```
            {
                "key": "ctrl+oem_2",
                "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
                "args": { "name": "scriptbrackets" }
            }
```
But if you try to insert this block to "keybindings-section" in a package.json of an extension it always calls the snippet selector dropdown (at the top of the window) and is NOT calling the snippet refered by the snippet name.

```
  "contributes": {
        "languages": [{
            "id": "f-script",
            "aliases": ["F-Script", "f-script"],
            "extensions": [".ff",".fs",".fss",".fx",".lb",".lbd",".lbf",".lbe",".lbi",".lbx",".config"],
            "configuration": "./language-configuration.json"
        }],
        "keybindings" : [
            {
                "key": "ctrl+oem_2",
                "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
                "args": { "name": "scriptbrackets" }
            }
        ]
	}

```

- VSCode Version: 1.17.0
- OS Version: WIN 10 PRO

Steps to Reproduce:
1. define a snippet
2. create a keybinding in keybinding.json
3. execute the keybinding in a file
4. try to move the keybinding to package.json.

Hope you can enable this feature also on language-extensions.

I personally have no need for recent files to be promoted to the top of the Goto File results:

These results actually slow me down, since I a used to Sublime Text fuzzy match behavior. If the "Recently Opened" results were not there, I would be able to jump to files in a predictable way.

    <Title>File Explorer hijacks keyboard focus somehow</Title>
    <Description>This has been an issue for me for months now on the insider edition as well as the stable version. I can't narrow down when or why it happens. (I decided to make an issue and see if others have noticed this or can narrow down how to reproduce it. If that's against guidelines this can be removed)

I'll be focused on an actual file and typing in new code will work, but the enter key, arrow keys, and delete will do actions within the file explorer instead of my code. I try hitting escape, spam clicking in the open file to try forcing a focus state change but that doesn't work. The only fix I could find is to open other files then go back to what I was working on.

2. Run the "Jest Tests" configuration, place a breakpoint on line 8 (console.log) of the test file, hover over 'boo' - nothing pops up. I expect to see the normal tooltip which inspects the contents of the variable. This works if I use the "mocha" framework instead of Jest.

    <Title>Broken fuzzy search algorithm in picker</Title>
    <Description>The fuzzy search algorithm can be improved to solve all problems listed in #27317, but IMHO it's completely broken and it should be rewritten from scratch. Let me show you some of the errors I've found:

### Doesn't work with leading spaces

This is the expected behavior:

![ok_todop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/30786853-bf457bbe-a17c-11e7-8ec2-aa033d618db4.gif)

This is what happens if the strings have some leading spaces (useful for extensions like [Projects+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-projects-plus) for showing a tree-like structure):

![broken_todop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/30786852-bf3df376-a17c-11e7-873e-8ecfc9c97465.gif)

### Not really "fuzzy"

As I understand it, the term "fuzzy" in "fuzzy search" basically means that the characters provided in the search query can have 0 or more other arbitrary characters between them in the matching string. The current algorithm looks like regular search instead:

![broken_fuzzy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/30786850-bf2daa20-a17c-11e7-8b45-0ce237e75cbe.gif)

### Overly strict about string position

For some reasons there are strings that match against some queries, but don't mach against less specific versions of those queries. I mean, a more specific query should provide the same or less results, not more, right?

![broken_start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/30786851-bf370bba-a17c-11e7-9b5d-3154847c59b4.gif)</Description>

Visual Studio lags every time I open it. Going into full-screen mode then going back fixes it but this is really annoying.
---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a file with visual studio
2. Lag happens
3. Go into full-screen mode
4. Go back to windowed mode
5. Lag is gone

(Lag doesn't happen while in full-screen mode either)

    <Title>Add setting to delete without sending to trash</Title>
    <Description>I'm on linux and want to have a file be immediately removed when I delete it from vscode. I don't want it moved to the trash directory but rather to be removed as if `rm` were being used. Please make it configurable as an option. None of the other apps I use move things to trash, so it creates an extra set of files for me to manage later. I manage my own recurring backups so I'm not worried about accidentally deleting something.</Description>

    <Description>Feature request: when I am writing a bulleted list (e.g. in Markdown or plain text) and hit enter I would like the editor to continue the line prefix.

Example:

* bullet 1
* bullet 2
[hit enter]
* [new line has bullet/spaces mimicking lines above]

Another key feature is if you hit enter on an otherwise unused bullet it will get out of list mode. I think you could do this as an extension, as well, but I haven't found one that does this.

Disabling tabs gives me nothing, since it still has one huge "Tab" at the top. Disabling tabs with `"workbench.editor.showTabs": false` only disables the tabs feature, it doesn't actually hide the top bar that's taking all the space. Even zen mode has the tabs.

    <Title>Live preview the selected quick open file in an unpinned editor</Title>
    <Description>This is an idea for a feature.

# Use case

I am a developer in a codebase that has files with the same or similar names. When I go to quick open one of these files I often have to guess which file is the right one because the full path isn't enough context for me to quickly remember which is the right one. I end up opening multiple files until I guess correctly and find the one that I really want.

FWIW, there are almost 70 non-unique file names in vscode. Many of these are pairs of interface and implementation. This happens in private code bases as well.
```
find src/ -name *.ts | grep '\([^/]\+\)$' -o | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head -n 20
```

# Proposal

1. User types a query into quick open (e.g. "actions.ts").
2. After a delay of no more input, the selected option (i.e. the file that would open if you hit enter) opens in an unpinned editor.
3. Cursoring up/down in the quick open list updates the unpinned editor with the selected file.
4. Hitting enter closed quick open and pins the editor.

Imagine a new unpinned editor behind quick open is live updating as I am cursoring up/down here:
![screen recording 2017-09-12 at 08 26 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754768/30334303-0a6f5954-9794-11e7-9021-cabf1cf11623.gif)

It isn't ideal that the quick open would obscure part of the file, but it would be better than nothing. 

Thoughts?

    <Description>Hi,

I'd like to make a feature request to exclude 'VM Scripts' that are dynamically created with `eval()` from the VS Code debugger as suggested by @roblourens [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46013729/vscode-debugger-exclude-node-vm-files?noredirect=1#comment78993320_46013729).

To make progress immediately, if a knowledgeable contributor can identify the code in the source, us open source users can start the grunt work of implementation.

[Some reading](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17367560/chrome-development-tool-vm-file-from-javascript), [relevant discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29897750/is-it-possible-to-blackbox-all-vm-scripts-in-chrome-debugger).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a file with Ctrl+P.  put cursor on line 100, and center line 100 on screen.  note the top line number.
2. open another file with Ctrl+P.  put cursor on line 100, and center line 100 on screen.  note the top line number.
3. click on the tab for the first file.  cursor will not be visible as line 100 will be scrolled off the top of the screen, top line will be anywhere from 20 to 120 lines greater than it was before.
4. click on the tab for second file.  cursor will cursor will not be visible as line 100 will be scrolled off the top of the screen, anywhere from 20 to 120 lines greater than it was before.
5. click on the tab for the first file again.  note that each time you click back to a tab, it has scrolled even farther from the cursor and what was last visible, leaving you to search for whatever the heck you were just reading when you went to reference another file.  

this is really annoying.

When toggling out of Full Screen (i.e. returning to a normal window), or when coming out of Zen Mode, the menu bar is a bit confused. The letters are underlined, as if the Alt key is being held down. See the attached screenshot.

    <Title>Feature request: allow skipFiles: "&lt;eval&gt;/*" pattern</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.15.1
- OS Version: macOS Sierra

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set `"skipFiles": ["node_modules/**", "&lt;node_internals&gt;/*", "&lt;eval&gt;/*"]` in `launch.json`
2. Use debugger to debug TypeScript or JavaScript
3. Eval scripts still stop the debugger

It would be nice if `&lt;eval&gt;/*` could be supported as a skip pattern just like `&lt;node_internals&gt;/*`. Apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong place!</Description>

    <Title>Feature: search up the directory hierarchy for .vscode settings</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.15.1
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a workspace with a .vscode settings directory
2. Open a subdirectory in the workspace with VS Code
3. VS Code doesn't apply the parent directory's settings

Reproduces without extensions: Yes

The purpose of this feature is to let people open a project directory within a larger workspace (which contains multiple projects) and still retain the team's workspace-level VS Code settings. Put more abstractly: when I open a subdirectory in a workspace, I want VS Code to recognize I am in that workspace.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open 3 projects. Separate it into 3 different spaces. Finalize the VS or restart the Mac. Using "window.restoreWindows": "all"
2. Reopen VS - all open right as before, but at the same space 0 (The current one).

The ideal would be re-open all three projects in the spaces as I determined. Thus improving productivity. And avoiding the stress of having to rearrange everything whenever you need to restart the MAC or even when there is a crash.

    <Title>Opening VS Code by double-clicking file in File Explorer forgets previously opened files</Title>
    <Description>If you have a mixture of saved and non-saved files open in VS Code...

- Quitting and restarting VS Code restores all the files that were previously open. Saved and non-saved. As expected.

- However, if you quit VS Code and then double-click on a text file in File Explorer, when VS Code starts it only opens the non-saved files (i.e. the "hot-saved" files) that were open previously, in addition the the new file that you double-clicked on to launch VS Code. All of the saved files that were previously open are forgotten about, and they are not restored.

I usually have a variety of text files open in VS Code and I would like the session to be restored whenever I restart VS Code, whether that is by explicitly launching VS Code from its shortcut, or by launching VS Code by double-clicking a file that it is registered for. The former works as I expect, but unfortunately the latter does not.</Description>

**Description**
The scroll position moves down as references are retrieved. For large files, the position can be many lines away.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set `typescript.referencesCodeLens.enabled` to `true`.
2. Open any TS file (easiest to see when the file contains an enum).
3. View a different file.
4. Return to the original file.

Sometimes it would be nice to be able to open a file in a real tab while having preview enabled. So quick open would still open in preview on enter, but on e.g. shift+enter or ctrl+enter it would open in a real tab.

How it could work:

1. ctrl+p, type filename
2. shift+enter to open in real tab, not preview (just enter would still open in preview)

Recently rebuilt my dev machine and installed VS Code. Did not have droid sans mono at first, so the text in the editor looked bad, finally fixed it to look like it should again. 

The issue now is that all other elements are not using "Droid Sans Mono" or any other monospaced font.

So I come from using sublime for years, so far I am enjoying VS Code, but there are a few usability things I'd like to raise. Can we change the behaviour when dragging a file tab out of the VSCode window that it automatically creates a new window and opens the file in there, and removes the tab from the original window? This is the behaviour in sublime, and it is very nice to be able to just drag a tab out to another monitor and continue coding.

Another thing which is similar, if you already have another window of VSCode open, and you drag a tab over to the other window it creates two instances of the open file, which is a problem because you can lose track which one you were using if you have many files/windows/tabs open. Changing the behaviour that dragging a tab over to another window closes the original tab reduces confusion. 

Can we make this default? If not, how would I go about changing it myself?

It's good feature but i hate it. It try to change my focus.
In my custom, after scroll the file to top, the top is always the first line of file.
But now, I can't sure the top is the first line of file or the Find widge.
It's uncertain! So I need a setting for toggle feature.

eg. when compare two file with two row, only one file show the Find widget, two file is not sync after scroll to top.

&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13885303/28562761-e0d2c8f6-7123-11e7-88b2-1ac6c86460e2.PNG" height="400" /&gt;

In full Visual Studio there is a feature to "Scope to This" in the Solution Explorer to virtually move the shown root folder to a sub-folder of the solution.

It would be great to have the same functionality in VSCode - this way the user could concentrate on the files that actually matter most of the time.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Load a different folder (I used File, Open Recent)
2. The window title bar still shows the &lt;original folder&gt; - &lt;file in that folder&gt;
3. Clicking on a file fixes it. Not sure if always does. I think it may get stuck not updating.
4. Clicking on a file tab rather than in the file (sometimes) doesn't change the window title.

    <Title>[feature request] Ignore/Hiding lint errors</Title>
    <Description>So I recently switched to VS Code and what I noticed is that having a global counter of file errors is handy. However, when say an error is not valid because the language doesn't support something yet, it is annoying to have these errors.

For example, in the CSS linter, there is an issue where the `@supports` rule isn't supported yet, or that the `/deep/` selector for Angular 4 isn't properly recognized. To make the errors go away I have to disable linting or (perhaps) disable rules that I don't want to disable. 

Also you can't limit the linter to only look at the existing file and get an overview of only that, so you are pretty limited to what you can and cannot do.

So my request is to extend the linting solution to allow errors to be hidden. Rightclick one and select `Hide error for this workspace` or something similar. And an option `only show errors for current file` would also be nice.

I also found out that it is pretty eager to validate my `node_modules` folder as well. I feel we also need a setting for workspace to specify linting exclusions (and/or globally)</Description>

    <Description>There doesn't seem to be any way at present of sorting the "Open Editors" section of the explorer menu by name or similar.  If I can't find a tab I tend to then look in Open Editors, but due to the inability to sort it can be almost as difficult to then find what I need.

    <Title>Use workspace/folder settings when file is opened outside of workspace</Title>
    <Description>Given a workspace `foo`, if file `foo/bar` is opened in VSCode standalone (not inside the `foo` workspace`), any settings in `foo/.vscode/settings.json` will not be picked up.

This matters when [using VSCode as a git mergetool](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5770). VSCode will open a file an editor to present the merge conflict, but the editor will not respect workspace settings. One example is where this is significant is formatter settings (like Prettier). Formatting the file will not respect project settings.

I understand workspace settings are specifically related to workspaces in VSCode, but I can't help but wonder if it makes sense to have "folder" settings which can be inherited from any parent folder for a given file. Has this idea been discussed?</Description>

    <Title>Visual Studio Code Server</Title>
    <Description>Hi,

I'd like to ask about feature that came recently to my mind.
Let's say that we have Vagrant or just plain VM.
Let's say we use Rust or similiar programming language where we have appropriate extensions for VSCode, but they require some time and knowledge to setup (Rust Language Server etc.).
Let's say that we have beginner programmers that may use Windows, Linux or Mac and it's cumbersome for them to setup development environment themselves, so it should be possible to just download code, run prepared Vagrant VM and have everything up and running.

Now, it would be nice if this virtual machine had some "Visual Studio Code Server" (and that's my requested feature), so we would have Visual Studio Code on our host machine that can connect to this server on VM (ssh?), use server's configuration, plugins and allow to browse file, folders, execute commands provided by extensions, use terminal, remotely.

I can see huge value in this feature, because it would allow to provide seamless, friendly experience, even for most complicated projects.

### Summary

Sometimes I open the Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P` by mistake, for example, while I actually want to open is the Goto Anything... `Ctrl+P`. So I press `Escape` key, to close the Command Palette. However doing so erases my last command inputted.


### Expected behavior

To remember the last inputted command on the Command Palette when it is closed by the `Escape` key. 

To clean the last inputted command on the Command Palette it is expected to:

1. Open the Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P`
1. Press the `Backspace` key
1. Press the `Escape` key to close the Command Palette


### Actual behavior

The last inputted command on the Command Palette is forgotten when the Command Palette is closed by the `Escape` key.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Enable the setting `"workbench.commandPalette.preserveInput": true,`
1. Open the Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P`
1. Type some command as `select`
1. Open the Command Palette again, you will notice your command `select` is remembered
1. Now press the `Escape` key
1. Open the Command Palette again
1. Your command `select` was forgotten

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;
Reproduces without extensions: Yes

    <Title>Minimal width for editor tabs</Title>
    <Description>I want to be able to customize the minimum width for editor tabs, to improving the number of tabbed pages on small monitor.

Options ideas:
1. Favicon only (perhaps cool only, may by keyboard to navigate; Best if can be achieve with extensions).
2. Customize min width, overflow only when will be less than this width.
3. Customize min number of characters on tabs, like 3 characters on head and other characters be hidden while overflow. `...` and duplicate name path hints need to be considered. Use hover to see the tooltips.
4. Based on the above, allow hover to expand a tab.
5. Refer to many extensions for tabbed browsers.

    <Title>Split Editor Pane's Initial State Should Be Empty</Title>
    <Description>As originally requested (and closed) in [issue 29651](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29651), when a user splits their editor pane, the new pane's initial state should be empty.

Currently the file in the active tab is duplicated in the new pane. This doesn't make sense to me. Frequently I open an additional editor pane in Sublime and drag a config file/notes/readme file to it from a location _outside_ of the currently loaded project directory(ies).

Obviously if a user explicitly selects a file to open in a new pane, the new pane should not be empty. I am _not_ talking about that use case.</Description>

    <Title>Scroll position not retained when switching back to a file that was opened from the source control diff section</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.13.1 (1.13.1)
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.4

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. open the diff view for any file from the Source Control panel
2. click the Open File button at the top-right corner of vscode
3. scroll to a different position in the file (doesn't matter if the cursor is also at the new position or the old position)
4. switch to a different file then back.

**What I saw:** the scroll position is back to where it was when the file was originally opened from the diff view.
**Expected:** the new scroll position should have been preserved; just like it does if the file was opened from the Explorer (or CMD+P)

Reproducible when vscode is started with extensions disabled.


**GIF of the bug:**
The cursor is moved from the initial line no.1577 to line no.1495. After switching back to this file, we are back to line no. 1577.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:13:05.928Z)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use `yo code` to create an extension pack
2. Add an extension dependency (e.g. [PeterJausovec.vscode-docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker))
3. Package as vsix (`vsce`) OR copy extension pack folder to .vscode/extensions/
4. Dependencies are not installed, and the "dependency" tab for the extension never loads, returning this trace:

    <Title>Expand settings pane to all editor groups</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.0
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.5

Usually I have 2 editor groups opened, so when I open settings it only uses one of the groups, making it difficult to edit. The settings pane has already two sections so you can imagine the trouble to make changes to it.

Having used SublimeText, I think they got this right. The default behaviour should be to open settings as if there is only one editor group, or at least open in a new window:

Currently there are some issues when using this configuration:
- The sidebar has a minimum width is not changeable and should be able to change the font size seperatly
- The sidebar is used for search results - there should be an option to put search results on the bottom panel with the other tabs (Problems, Output, etc.)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Press CTRL+Shift+H and search for an existing variable that you know exists across multiple pages
2. Click on the code line in the results panel and instead of seeing the preview I get a blank screen. Or, I'll see the preview but when I hit CTRL+Shift+1 to replace the item and go to the next item the preview window will blank out instead of showing code change preview.

    <Title>Include announcement section for extension authors</Title>
    <Description>Sometimes extension authors like me at `settings-sync` need to announce something, which may large chunk of users wont care but some users though. Hence allow authors to interact with users by showing announcements.

Currently there is not way other then that I am showing the message upon the code start and users takes it as spam or whatever.
When they click on the message, link should be opened, or the message can have multiple buttons.

If there is announcement section in the extension with a notification badge in the extensions will allow users to view them anytime, unlike they are doing right now to close the information message box every time.

    <Title>Base64 and line column limitation?</Title>
    <Description>In this recent version, I noticed that some longer base64 encoded strings didn't allow me to pan to the end of the line. When opening the file, the line wrap is turned on, when I turn line wrap off, I cannot navigate to the end of those lines using the arrow keys. I believe the data is still all there, just causes navigation issues. It seems perhaps this is a limitation in the number of columns? The color coding does not display the same as other shorter lines, so I don't know if it isn't recognized properly or just isn't displaying all of the data.

I have included a sample of one giving me trouble.

- OS Version: Linux version 4.10.11-1-ARCH (builduser@tobias) (gcc version 6.3.1 20170306 (GCC) )

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a task in json
```{
            "taskName": "Make Local",
            "command": "make",
            "args": ["-C", "${fileDirname}", "CONFIG_OPT=no", "-sj4", "local"],
            "isShellCommand": true,
            "showOutput": "silent",
            "isBuildCommand": true,
            "problemMatcher": {
                "owner": "cpp",
                "fileLocation": "absolute",
                "pattern": {
                    "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
                    "file": 1,
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 3,
                    "severity": 4,
                    "message": 5
                }
            }
        }```
1. There's no way to pop up the `Problem` tab when there are problems, only the `Output` tab unconditionally (which no longer has click-able filenames apparently?)

The `Problems` tab is quite useful, but the task definition should support a new property `showProblems` which opens the `Problems` tab if any problems are found in the output. Otherwise no change to the current behavior. `showProblems` should override `showOutput` in the case that there are detected problems.

    <Description>As a Mac user, I expect all folders act the same behavior just like they do in Finder or Xcode:

1. click the folder: just select the folder (**not expands/collapses it**).
2. click the disclosure triangle: expands/collapses the folder.
3. `option + arrow-right/arrow-left` on a selected folder: expands/collapses all sub-folders in the hierarchy.
4. hold `option` and click the disclosure triangle: just like what `option + arrow-right/arrow-left` do to expands/collapses all sub-folders in the hierarchy.

Current behaviors which I did not expect:

1. Simply clicking the folder will expands/collapses the folder (should just select it).
2. Can't find a familiar way to expands/collapses all sub-folders in the hierarchy (using `option`).

I really do expect that VSCode team can fulfill this expectation in Explorer.</Description>

    <Title>Option to override globally disabled extension in workspace settings</Title>
    <Description>VScode currently has the option to disable an extension for certain workspaces.
However, there are extensions such as Arduino and the likes which are _very_ workspace specific and negatively impact the overall experience if enabled outside that environment.

Instead of having to manually disable those extensions for every workspace, I suggest making it possible to enable an extension for a workspace even if it is globally disabled.

The current behaviour does not allow you to enable the extension for a workspace if it is disabled globally:

I have the following keybinding:

```json

        "when": "editorTextFocus"

```

When I am using `git` and I am entering a commit message, by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl+enter&lt;/kbd&gt; to commit the message, the editor commits it but it also goes into zen mode. Based on my `when` statement, it shouldn't do that since I am using `editorTextFocus`.</Description>

    <Title>Refactor when moving files</Title>
    <Description>The best feature you could have is to refactor when moving files in the explorer (out of the box) 
There is a extension (move ts) but it's buggy. 
It's a basic refactor thing, which to my surprise is not in visual code. 

So if i move a file from a folder to another, i want it's path reference to be updated automatically in the project. I tried this on a angular 2 project with .ts files and it did not work. I haven't tried with other files.

    <Title>Debuging, error linking to file and row by lines number from output [DEBUG CONSOLE]</Title>
    <Description>I'm not happy with solutions to execute code, scripts, etc.

 

- [ ] I want sugest solution with linking to file and row lines number from output to place where is error for debuging this place (line). Something like hyberlink.

1. python
` File "e:\PYTHON\test.py", line 10, in TestFunction self.test= SuperTest(self)`
- **line 10** can be as hyperlink to row 10 in test.py file (e:\PYTHON\test.py or e:/PYTHON/test.py) 
 File "e:\PYTHON\test.py", [line 10](/PYTHON/test.py#10), in TestFunction self.test= SuperTest(self)

There is **vscode-code-runner** plugin, but it's far in pratice from the optimal solutions what exist on market and other editors. 
https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner/issues/111

BTW all errors methods for output from debugers is little old and simple, eg. why the outputs lines are not numered as rows (1. error 2. bug 3. noFunction) which can be more usefull in social consulting, citating the row only as number of row/line and etc.
Eg. PyScripter for Python is old and not much changes and have nice solutions as upper, eg. can show current bug
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/

Maybe in ServerSide coding is not special needed, but not sure.. I mind that output is serverd on the web browser front side.

- [ ] Let we imagine that in MVC exist some bugs.. I repair them in some files and want run again the main script.. must find this file and execute. In my good pratice is that ctr+E execute current file and ctr+shift+E execute the last file or file setted as main in all project. This can help fast reduce number of errors in output and stupid clicking process (expensive time and booring way).
- In VSC is ctr+shift+f5 but in debug mode. If I chaning file to repair and try run this.. again execute current file and must back to the main.py and find this.

    <Title>Filter folders for formatOnSave  </Title>
    <Description>We run a bigger project where we've recently added prettier and are using the `formatOnSave` option. However, we don't want to run the formatting process on files that are not part of a few directories.

Is it possible to add another option so I can configure a regex that will be tested against the filename before `formatOnSave` will be triggered? A glob would work as well.

I have this workspace open in VSCode 1.11:

| /.gitignore     | a.txt    |
| /a.txt          | aaa      |

Search for "aaa" with "Use Ignore Files" enabled yields this:

These two search results shouldn't show up, should they? I've tried this on a workspace where Git repo actually exists (`.git` present) and where it doesn't with the same result.

8. `pkill -9 -f 'flow'` peace at last

I'm not sure if this a problem with the specific extension, but VSCode should not allow processes spawned by extensions to stay running after the editor has quit. I almost completely locked up my computer trying out several Flowtype extensions, not realizing they were all spawning background tasks that didn't die.

I also now have no idea what other background processes VSCode has left open from extensions.

    <Title>Prominently indicate whether an editor or the panel has focus</Title>
    <Description>This is a feature request.

I keep catching myself starting to type a terminal command while it's the editor that currently has focus. When the focus is on the sidebar, this is easy to see — for example, selected file is white-on-blue, or the search box has blue border. I think there should be a similarly prominent visual indication of focus being on an editor or on the bottom panel.

PS To anyone having the same issue — I think setting

    "terminal.integrated.cursorBlinking": true,
    "terminal.integrated.cursorStyle": "block"

 should mitigate this a bit.</Description>

    <Title>Feature Request: Open Code from stdout</Title>
    <Description>I think there could be some interesting uses for being able to populate the contents of a new Untitled document from stdout via command-line. I frequently dump data from a process to a file and open it in Code, but that's usually not a file I want to save, I just want to view the contents in Code. This functionality would save me several steps.

For example:
```powershell
PS C:\&gt; '{"key": "value"}' | code
```
Would start up Code like this.

    <Title>File icons for default languages outside of VS Code (icons in Finder)</Title>
    <Description>## Description

I would like to be able to distinguish my Objective-C .h, .m, Markdown, and Swift (and any other programming/markup language) files from one another in the Finder when VS Code is set to be the default app for opening these files. Currently all the files show the same VS Code document icon. When files are set to be opened by Xcode by default the file icons are different based on their type. Additionally it would be nice if external packages could dictate different images for different file types.

## Steps to Reproduce

Set VS Code to be the default app for opening Objective-C and Swift files.
View file icons in Finder
#### Expected behavior: [What you expected to happen]

File icons are different based on the file type.

#### Actual behavior: [What actually happened]

File icons are all the same VS Code document icon.

    <Title>Backspace between the beginning of the line and the first non-space character should erase a "tabful" of spaces</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

This is something Sublime does, and I find it very useful.

Say you have tabs set to 4 spaces - if you press tab, the editor will behave as if you have added a tab, but in reality it will **add** spaces. The opposite should also be true - if you hit backspace, it should **remove** enough spaces to make it look like you have deleted a tab.

Example (• = space, | = tab stop, _ = cursor)

    ••••|••_•let x: string;

When hitting backspace, the editor should simply erase all the four spaces that make up the "tab", both before and after the cursor

    ••••let x: string;

That's only important at the beginning of a line for me (there may be other use cases) and of course a preference setting to control would be perfectly fine. Thanks</Description>

    <Description>Hello there, will be nice to have an error handler from output console; I mean, if I want to compile a file with gcc/g++ or make (from task.json) and during compilation there are some errors, will be great to (Ctrl +) click on the error showed on output console of Visual Studio Code and to be redirected to specified file at specified line number and column number (like in Eclipse).

The format error string showed on the output console is like (in python it is almost the same) :
fileName:line number:column number: error: description error

Just an error example:
file.cpp:630:6: error: expected '}' before 'else'

What do you think? I think this feature can improve a lot the productivity.

    <Title>VS Code should enable navigation for more file/line formats</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.10.0-insiders

**Issue**: VS Code has a filter that runs over text sent to the debug console which enables navigation if the text looks like '\&lt;filePath\&gt;:\&lt;line\&gt;:\&lt;column\&gt;'. But I am not aware of a way (and please correct me if I am  wrong) to add in more 'file/line/column' scrappers. .NET Core internally will sometimes dump stack traces to the output stream in its format. It would be nice if they were navigable, but they are currently not.

**Trivial example to reproduce the problem**:
Run the following code which will dump two string to the debug console:
```
   at Program.SleepThread(Object obj) in d:\proj\clicon\Program.cs:line 23
   at Program.SleepThread(Object obj) in d:\proj\clicon\Program.cs:23:0
```

**Expected Result**
Both links should be navigable

**Actual Result**
Only the second (artificial) link is.

Trivial example to show the problem:
```csharp
            try
            {
                throw new Exception("My example exception");
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.WriteLine(e.StackTrace);
                Debug.WriteLine(e.StackTrace.Replace("line ", "") + ":0");
            }

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a codebase with a large number of **errors** and **warnings** in the source files
2. Open the Problems panel
3. Type the keyword _"error"_ in the filter input to show only **errors** and filter out **warnings**

Current behaviour:

- Any **warnings** which contain the word _"error"_ in their message also appear alongside **errors**

Desired behaviour:

- The possibility to categorically show only one type of problem. This could be done, for example, with search operators like _"type:error"_, &amp;c.

    <Title>Create environment variable within user/workspace settings</Title>
    <Description>It would be great if you could define variables (and/or environment variables) within the user/workspace settings.

Example: 

```json
{
    "variables": {
        "MY_VAR": "foo"
    },
    "environment_variables": {
        "MY_ENV_VAR": "bar"

    "some_first_setting": "${var.MY_VAR}",
    "some_second_setting": "${env.MY_ENV_VAR}"
}
```

I have the same path typed multiple times in my settings, and if I wish to change it, I have to change the path in multiple places. This feature request could enable more complex settings as you could use paths based on variables.

I'm also keeping my fingers crossed that  [settings overrides](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1587#issuecomment-273397301) will be implemented and that both such overrides as well as defining variables could enable something like this:

```json
{

    "environment_variables": {
        "CONDAENVS": "${workspaceRoot}../condaenvs"
    },

    "windows": {
        "python.pythonPath": "${env.CONDAENVS}/env_win/",

    "osx": {
        "python.pythonPath": "${env.CONDAENVS}/env_osx/"
    }
}
```

Similarly would may be useful to exclude the current directory.

    <Title>Go to file - allow to type folder name after file name for better narrowing of many results</Title>
    <Description>User typed 'types':

Notice how there are multiple files with the same name and then there is useful folder name after the file name to distinguish the files - but as soon as user starts typing folder name - hoping that it will filter the values - it returns empty result:

It would be very helpful if `types comm` would return:

I know I can press Ctrl+Shift+M and see all problems, but that's kinda something I don't want to do if I already see the output log. I want to see something Visual Studio does when compiling the project, for example...</Description>

    <Title>Make the space for tabs configurable (min, max, normal)</Title>
    <Description>When i am using vscode with file icons activated on my 13' Macbook, i quickly get a problem with the number of tabs actually visibles.

&lt;img width="1381" alt="capture d ecran 2016-12-23 14 16 08" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/21454811/bf9ae4f8-c91b-11e6-8f30-0e2d9bd52e54.png"&gt;

Especially for long file names in my project :

&lt;img width="1084" alt="capture d ecran 2016-12-23 14 29 54" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/21454896/54b4b9d8-c91c-11e6-9ce6-4ffaa2c435e9.png"&gt;

This is annoying for angular projects with every file named "file.**component**.ts" or "file.**service**.ts".


What i suggest is two things : 

# **First**

it could be great to adding a config in settings.json to allow the display of tabs another potential way, here is a suggestion when the screen is not split :

&lt;img width="1384" alt="capture d ecran 2016-12-23 14 11 01" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/21455614/f9e0b7e0-c921-11e6-85bf-4f9ce1725612.png"&gt;

By moving this bar just behind after the code of the title bar : 

&lt;img width="1385" alt="capture d ecran 2016-12-23 14 06 02" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/21454835/e9d6ace8-c91b-11e6-8365-1df8791ddae8.png"&gt;

I could be awesome, and i'm not sur we can do thing like that with an extension.

# **Second**

It could be possible to add a filter on text size for tabs, or a way to limit the size with a [css ellipsis](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/truncate-string-with-ellipsis/).

Thanks to consider.

Often when I bootstrap new projects, I like to grab existing files like `.eslintrc` and `.gitignore` from other projects. I've noticed that I cannot right-click a file in one workspace, and paste it into a different directory tree in another workspace.

It would be great to have a cut, copy, and pasting of files across the clipboard in a future update. Particularly because getting hidden files to show up in OSX Finder is a pain.</Description>

    <Title>UX about inline traffic light</Title>
    <Description>I'm thinking about picking up #12628, but would like to get some input from the UX team, so we can get the design right.

## Current State

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/20053382/88475732-a4d8-11e6-97aa-80eb257c5264.png)

However, this design doesn't work when activitybar is hidden or in the right.

## Electron's limitation

Electron allows one of the four following styles, but they can't be changed at runtime. Would need a restart of VSCode to use another style.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21313907/4580a386-c62f-11e6-9984-a08284442a28.png)

## Points of Discussion

### To make the inline traffic lights work, there are three options:

1. When inlining traffic lights into activitybar, lock activitybar so user can't hide it or move it to the right.

2. Tweak the sidebar and tabbar, so they could contain the traffic lights. Chrome-style tabbar is achievable:

    ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/19407942/0deedfac-92b1-11e6-9a5c-ae38a3a3b28b.png)

    **but I can't find a good way to let sidebar contain traffic lights**. Haven't seen other OS X app putting traffic light in sidebar either.

3. Instead of inlining traffic lights into activitybar, we inline the traffic lights into a **custom titlebar**. This is how many macOS apps are designed, like Mail, iTunes and Safari:

    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21311564/c7c6dc32-c622-11e6-83f5-8f4188b85805.png)

1 is easy to implement. 3 feels right design-wise. 2 probably isn't worth pursuing, as it involves a lot effort for a not-so-good design.

### Do we also add such a feature for Windows?

- If so, I think inlining traffic lights into custom titlebar is better, as the "traffic lights" are to the right in Windows. Borrowing @be5invis's mockups...

    This looks natural:

    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21310986/f094e698-c61f-11e6-978c-7457d924e882.png)

    Whereas this one looks odd, and doesn't account for the case when both activitybar and sidebar are hidden. It also leaves no space for menu items.

    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21311076/4dc9b8d4-c620-11e6-920d-a48a96eb90b2.png)

## My thoughts

Overall, I feel 3 is better than 1 in terms of usability and cross-platform design consistency.

It seems @bpasero already made a custom titlebar for macOS. If we choose design 3, I can try to make `titleBarStyle: custom` for Windows. If we choose to push the original idea forward, I want to get some input from the UX team for the usability concerns.

    <Title>Tab double click to maximize editor of the tab</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8
- OS Version: Mac OS Sierra

Hello,

if I'm not wrong, by double clicking the tab it pins the file . Personally, I would prefer to expand the file editor / collapsing the menu on the left. It would be same behaviour as the File Explorer button on the top left. Is it possible? Or, can people customize the tab double click? 
People could set a pin option on each tab and the double click expands the file editor window.
Or, if simpler, set the option in a right click context menu on each tab. Isn't it?

Thanks a lot

Sublime Text shows file previews live when fuzzy searching. It'd be cool to have this feature in VSCode.

1. Press CMD+P to search for files.
2. While using the arrow keys to move through the entries, the current entry should be visible as a preview tab.

    <Title>Alert messages covering the tab bar is just a bad idea</Title>
    <Description>I've been trying to switch to VS Code for a while, but one single annoyance makes me stop using it: any kind of error or informational message covers the tab bar, making me unable to do anything unless I dismiss it.  This could be a plugin announcing a new feature, or a plugin announcing that there is a warning.  For example, Unity projects always announce warnings when they build, so for every build, the tabs hide behind a message.

One possible solution: an icon appears in the status bar when errors appear. Clicking on it shows them. Clicking outside hides them.

    <Title>Supported File Live Previews</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.2
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12 Public Beta (16B2657)

My idea is to open files supported by the OS, VSC extensions, etc as a file in preview mode. For example, right clicking an html file then clicking "Open as Preview" will open a new tab as if its a file and show the contents in a simple frame. If you are wanting to see an example I've edited to look like the new feature I'm requesting, well here you go...

![](http://i.imgur.com/gUeMsUo.jpg)
![](http://i.imgur.com/Knt9UsA.jpg)

I'm sorry, I'm not the best at photoshopping but I did my best. This is kind of what I mean. If the file is being view without a workspace (alone as a single file), then there would be a button next to "Split view" at the top right near the exit button that will open the file as a preview file if it is supported by an extension, software, raw file view by OS or is supported by VSC. If the file you want to preview is in a workspace (currently open is a folder viewing workspace), then there would be an option to right click the file then "Open as Preview" or the same way you would open it as a singular file (without workspace). I tried my best to explain what I mean but if you are still having trouble understanding, just take a look at the images above. Please note that there is a reload button on the top right of the preview side of the second image, that will reload the preview to be updated with the code. A second idea (possibility) is a JavaScript Developer Console can be put below the preview with JavaScript errors, warnings and logs like Chrome does but that is optional.</Description>

    <Title>Keep separate sizes for each viewlet (helps to read extensions better)</Title>
    <Description>This is an simple **Enhancement proposal**.

The current behaviour for all the panel tabs (explorer / git / extension etc ...) is to keep its size permanently whatever the active tab is. But it's very annoying when you like extensions.

Here is a small workflow example :

So, when i'm working on my files on **explorer** i give the tab a reasonable small size to maximise my workspace size : 

&lt;img width="267" alt="capture d ecran 2016-11-21 a 19 57 08" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/20496315/f7d68c4c-b024-11e6-9fe0-0239a6956425.png"&gt;

Then, if i go to the "Extension" tab, the same size is preserved (current default behaviour) : 

&lt;img width="258" alt="capture d ecran 2016-11-21 a 19 57 21" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/20496339/11c4d0aa-b025-11e6-90b7-6a861875fab1.png"&gt;

But it hide all the most important things i want to know about extensions including icon, notes, version and for most cases, number of downloads. Which is a bunch of needed informations to judge the popularity of an extension.
At this moment in my workflow, i manually size up the tab to obtains this, which is very more comfortable and pretty : 

&lt;img width="435" alt="capture d ecran 2016-11-21 a 19 56 48" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/20496392/46ca8f92-b025-11e6-9100-7fd5dfbf6c22.png"&gt;

When i'm done this my extensions, i get back to my "explorer" tab, and get this result with so many space lost : 

&lt;img width="468" alt="capture d ecran 2016-11-21 a 19 56 38" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/20496519/cf2a4f58-b025-11e6-9d18-3cf0f53e7de0.png"&gt;

And i have to reduce the size again.
A good alternative for that could be to save the tab sizes, at least for the extension tab.

It's not a big deal, but small details makes great editors ;)

    <Title>Add support for multiple windows (docking panels) for the bottom panel</Title>
    <Description>I moved to Code from Webstorm and never regreted it, VSCode is just great, however I miss one thing which was amazing in WS and it was the support for multiple panels or tabs docked at the bottom of the screen, for example in vscode if I am debugging and have the debugging console open, I cannot see the terminal or some other useful windows that could be displayed in that area of the screen at the same time. It would be awesome to have tabs or the possibility to dock panels at the bottom to make easier switching among the different tools available.  In fact, the ability to dock panels, I think, is what made Visual Studio amazing and is a feature that other editors like Atom, Brackets or Sublime totally lack. 

Hopefully this is something doable and many others like the idea.  </Description>

    <Title>Support for empty editor groups</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1

Really annoying thing: I want to open new file [to the side](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/codebasics#_side-by-side-editing). When I do that, it shows the same file. When I use `Ctrl+P`, newly created, duplicated file, stays in background.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Go to any file
2.  Press `Ctrl+\`
3. The same file opens up as I've been to. When I then use `Ctrl+P` to open another one, it stays in background.

[Video of how it looks like](https://gfycat.com/GreatShabbyGoldeneye)

What I propose:

1. Don't open the same file after using `Ctrl+\` (why would I want to have a file opened two times?). Show blank space instead.
2. Or at least close this file when I use `Ctrl+P` to open another one.</Description>

It would be a great thing to permit **real-time collaboration on code** between users.

I used Floobits in Sublime, and they also created a great extension for Atom. https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-atom

I know that VSCode team is working on some third party extensions, so would it be conceivable for you to work on a Floobits extension, or at least check that VSCode API has all necessary features for it?

    <Description>A nice usability feature of select menus in browsers is, once focussed, you can start typing the name of an entry and the browser will select any matches. E.g, if I had options "foo", "bar", "baz", and I typed "ba" when the select is focussed, the browser would select "bar" for me.

    <Title>Allow for floating and/or movable sidebar views</Title>
    <Description>I'm using VS Code for a while (since 1.0 or so) and sometimes it's quite annoying that multiple sidebar views can't be used at once.

Most notable issue is that debugger view too tight and it's necessary to expand it every time. But then editor window becoming too narrow.
At the same time it's completely useless to have such wide view for explorer, git or search.
So, You have to drag or toggle sidebar every time when you need to debug.
If you have monitor that something less than 1080p it leads to real problems in usability.

The best solution in my opinion is to make at least debugger view detachable. Such approach is very convenient to use with dual-monitor configuration.

Other solution is to optionally move this watcher view to bottom panel where debug console located. Maybe it'll hard to use with debug console at the same time but JetBrains IDEs uses similar layout and it works fine.</Description>

1. No matter what I choose, when I do either of the above, wanting to close all open files, I end up exiting the editor. What an annoyance! I'm just trying to close all files is all. Why is it exiting if I didn't ask it to exit? A program should not jump to conclusions. Is there a desire here to emulate Google Chrome's behavior? Chrome is not such a "perfect" browser, FYI, and closing the browser when I close all the tabs is not what I want. Don't assume. If I want to exit I'll do a &gt;File &gt;Exit.

I'm unfamiliar with this codebase. But I think that [`match-sorter`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter) provides a better way to filter and sort items in a list based on user input. Could we consider adding that kind of functionality to VSCode?

    <Description>At work I can only use a small screen, and I need the explorer view always open.
The matter is that keeping it opened leaves very small place for actual code.
So I started looking for a undocking option, but I found out that there's none.
I'd really love to be able to switch between explorer and code in two different windows (just like I do, for example, with Chrome and Chrome Debugger).

(I don't know how to add tags to the request, I wanted to use explorer-files, feature-request, ux)

    <Title>API: view management API for non-TextEditors</Title>
    <Description>Request: API support for managing non-`TextEditor` views. The functionality should support:
- show()
- hide()/close()
- move tabs/groups
- on-closed event (#12114, #13623)
- on-focus-changed event (via `onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` or new `onDidChangeActiveView`)
- presence in `visibleTextEditors` or new `visibleViews` (#6941)

In particular, `previewHtml` should return an object that provides the above functionality,

_Example use case:_ I create a preview for each open document of a certain file type. (The preview is derived from the current state of processing the document; not its contents.) Typically, the documents are all on the left column and their previews are on the right. When interacting with the document, its associated preview should become visible (without receiving focus); moving to a different column than the document itself if necessary. Without this kind of functionality, it easy for the user of my extension to become lost and confused when interacting with multiple documents.

    <Title>Needed validation in `contributes.keybindings` for extension manifest</Title>
    <Description>While building a keymap extension I ran into an issue. 

I created a keybinding contribution as seen below:

``` json
{
  "mac": "ctrl+shift+pageup",
  "win": "alt+shift+pageup",
  "linux": "alt+shift+pageup",
  "command": "cursorColumnSelectPageUp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus" 
}
```

What is wrong with the above? 

Once I debugged the extension I found the issue. 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2449568/19569406/77f42bee-96aa-11e6-937b-9c9cc4eaf2bb.png)

Two things could be fixed here:

1 - The error message is too large and so I cannot see what is going on. I did figure out that I can see the same error in the debug console. It would be better if there was a way to see the complete message in the error box. (ping @bgashler1 @stevencl on this one)
2 - I would've expected to have caught this with the JSON validation of the file. We should introduce a squiggle line indicating that the keybinding object is missing a required `"key"` property. 
3 - The error message should indicate the line number where the issue exists. See the debug console error message below does not give me an indication where the problem is. 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2449568/19569706/9e057a44-96ab-11e6-80c3-6ba0e21e314e.png)

To fix this today, I simply need to add the `key` property. 

``` json
{
  "mac": "cmd+shift+l",
  "win": "ctrl+shift+l",
  "linux": "ctrl+shift+l",
  "key": "ctrl+shift+l",
  "command": "editor.action.insertCursorAtEndOfEachLineSelected",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

As an aside, I created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14112 to address the necessity of the `"key"` property.

    <Description>As shown in the picture below we are not displaying multi-line errors in the error list. I would expect that multi-line errors occupy the correct number of lines.

I know you are using the tree widget as the underlying implementation, so you can check the repl which does the same. Uses the tree but for elements that are multiple lines it [reserves additional lines](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/replViewer.ts#L119).

I am passionate about removing the error zone widget and this is one of the rare things that the error list is missing which the error zone widget provides.

    <Title>File search (ctrl + E) should suggest more relevant options</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From anywhere inside VSC, ctrl + E opens a dialog to search by file name. 
2. Start typing, list of options appear. 

Unfortunately, the options are not sorted by any relevance (recently opened, or files from folder currently working on). It would be great if this could be improved!

Example: 

I have 6 files open, all from a folder called .../userSettings/
I want to open a 7th file called main.js from that same folder so I type ctrl + E, "main.js"
I have a main.js file in a dozen different folders in my project, so I get a list of all the main.js from all my folders, but I would expect userSettings/main.js to be at the top of the list as I'm working on that folder. Failing that, it should still be at the top of the list because I worked on it an hour ago and closed it, and I'm reopening it again (having not worked on any other main.js from other folders in a while).

Hope this makes sense! Thanks

The output text contains an link with useful information provided by the codelyzer JS package but that link is not intractable by any means, I cannot click the link or copy the text to manually paste it in the browser.
## Expected/desired behavior

The text in the output to be intractable, best would be any http links to be directly clickable but simply letting us copy the output error/warnings would also be acceptable.

    <Title>Support dark theme in Gnome</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5
- OS Version: Linux

I do use light theme on my linux distribution, but in VScode i prefer standard dark theme for editor, so i desired to try to change a gtk theme for single window as i do often with several applications modifying their launchers and .desktop files, and had no success. As i figured out VScode doesn't use gtk for window decorations, so i tried xprop to change theme variant to dark. What i got is that window decoration changed to dark, but menu is still using old light style.

It would be great if VScode will start to use CSD (client side decorations) like in most native and not native gnome apps, so i request this feature too

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Use light gtk theme, that support dark variant, like Arc-GTK
1. Type in terminal: xprop -f _GTK_THEME_VARIANT 8u -set _GTK_THEME_VARIANT "dark"
2. Click VScode window
3. Notice that decorations turned to dark, but menu is still light
3. Cry.

    <Title>Extend the API to add custom file opener</Title>
    <Description>I wanted to port the [pdf-view](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view) extension for atom to vscode.

One thing that I came across that I don't know how to do it in vscode is atom's ability to add custom file openers: https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.8.0/Workspace#instance-addOpener

I'm pretty new to vscode so correct me if I'm wrong but without such API one would have to take a detour through the command palette to open a PDF file with pdfjs and the intuitive way via "Open File..." and (double) clicking on the file tree wouldn't work.

    <Title>Moving a set of adjacent editor cursors does not move the editor's viewport to them </Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.4.0-insider (f4780e67933164a2289b86f2c279aaa05fda672f, 2016-07-19T05:12:40.233Z)
- OS Version: Linux x64 4.4.0-31-generic, Ubuntu 16.04

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open large file
2. Add cursor somewhere
3. Add cursor down command
4. Scroll down with mouse
5. Press up, notice the viewport doesn't move. With a single cursor the viewport will go to the cursor.

Maybe this should be a special case for when cursors either can fit within the viewport and/or are all adjacent to each other?

    <Title>Warn before closing the window when closing editor without having editor open</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: OS X El Capitan

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a few tabs/editors running in your window
2. cmd + w to close the current one, until no one is left
3. Next cmd + w will close the entire editor

Should warn the user that the entire editor will be closed and the choice to cancel.
This is just an idea since it happens all the time for me, though I understand the current implementation as it do exactly what the command says – closes the window.

    <Description>I am building an extension/debugger combination for Clojure that uses the debug console to display the output from a continuously running REPL. I need to be able to evaluate code selected in an editor outside of the normal `Debug: evaluate` path (primarily so the extension can identify the namespace in which to execute the code). I have this working, but I would like to display the the result in the debugger  #console.

    <Title>Question / Request: Shortcut to expand multi-cursors to word boundaries</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider
- OS Version: Windows 8 x64

Question: Is there a way to expand multi cursors to select each current word, even when the words aren't the same?

Here is an example of attempting to convert javascript object notation to properly quoted JSON, using multicursor support and the ctrl+d shortcut.

Functionality in Sublime (middleclick+drag, ctrl+d):
![2016-06-07t09_09_14-multiselect_word_boundaries](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4721566/15910086/36a7e558-2d7e-11e6-94c9-c93417c97b2b.gif)

Functionality in VSCode (leftclick, shift+alt+leftclick+drag, ctrl+d):

Is there a shortcut / function that I'm missing which will expand all cursors to their respective boundaries? I know I can _technically_ get the same functionality through usage of ctrl+arrow key to get to the beginning or end of a boundary (where necessary) followed by shift+ctrl+arrow key in the opposite direction, but I've done it with a single shortcut for so long that the habit may be difficult to break.

    <Description>At first, moving lines up and down didn't seem to work at all, but then I found a stranger issue. Notice how line 6 becomes a mix of lines 5 and 7:

![bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/15774263/c4dca018-297b-11e6-807a-319997effbfe.gif)

Here's the buffer, notice the first line is empty, so you can move the lines up.

```

        if (this.mergeDecorator) {
            this.mergeDecorator.dispose();
            this.mergeDecorator = null;
        }

        if (!this.contextService || !this.gitService) {
            return;
        }
```

Steps:
- Put cursor right before the first `if`
- Duplicate cursor down 5 times
- Move lines up

    <Title>[API] Provide Virtual Document in window.visibleEditors or similar</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.1-insiders
- OS Version: Win10

I know window.visibleEditors is supposed to contain actual text editors but it is not possible to tell at the moment if a VirtualDocument (ie a htmlContentProvider) is in view.

The scenario I would need this for is for detecting if a Virtual Document has focus when a command is triggered. If there is another work around for this please let me know.

func noname() {}
panic("lol")
func noname() {}
panic("lol")
```
1. Select `"func noname() {}\npanic(\"lol\")"` and press `Cmd+D` to try to select the multiple instances of the string `"func noname() {}\npanic(\"lol\")"`.
2. It doesn't work.
3. Try the same thing in Atom or Sublime Text; it works.

chrome has already a built in spell-checker, is there any way to use that rather than that extension? or aspell?

    <Description>The maximum number of editors currently is **three**.  There doesn't appear to be a way to change this in user settings.

It would be helpful and flexible if there was a configuration option in user settings to override this default max value (i.e. some developers might be able to handle four or five editors and still feel "organized").

I like the max editor cap, but I believe the count of max editors should be configurable.

    <Description>Diagnostics for empty/blank lines are hard to discover as a user.

For example, the tslint rule `no-consecutive-blank-lines` flags the second blank line as a warning. This puts a green mark on the right gutter but gives no indication at the actual location of the error in the editor. It might be found through the "Errors and Warnings" interfaces, but if the project contains many other issues (perhaps in other files or a dependency) this might not work either.

The terminal selector on the left of the _New Terminal_ button is not so convenient. We have to click two times to change to another terminal.
I think it's better to change the selector to tabs so that we can click one time to change current terminal. Or we can optimize it so that we can use a mousedown-mousemove-mouseup style to change the terminal like the selector on the mac os.</Description>

The 'multi cursor' work when i press 'ctrl + alt + up/down'(my key bindings). But it doesn't work with mouse.

Steps :

1. Holding the 'alt' key
1. Holding the 'main' key(in mouse) and drag the mouse cursor vertically, and it's behavior is same as holding the 'command' key at `step 1`. It is just a 'multi line', not 'multi cursor'!

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Example code below when beautification  takes place, all code after ```++ &lt;``` becomes green. Issue seems to be around this operator combination, if I change this to ```++ &lt;=``` beautification  works as expected. If I remove the ```++``` this also solves the problem.

    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version:
1.17.2

- OS Version:
Windows 7 SP1 Enterprise 64-bit

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VSCode in the directory with the following file structure
```
/
|-- foo/
    |-- foo.js
|-- bar/
    |-- foo.js
|-- foo.js
```
2. Press Ctrl+P (Go to File...). Type foo.js in the search box. All three foo.js files are shown.
3. Add the following to Workspace Settings
```
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "f*/": true
    }
}
```
The intention is to hide the foo folder in the Explorer. In real life I have a lot of folders starting with f and I don't want to list them all, hence using a wildcard (note the / at the end). I would expect the following shown in the explorer:
```
/
|-- bar/
    |-- foo.js
|-- foo.js
```
I would also expect foo.js and bar/foo.js to be found by Go to File.

**Actual Result**:
1. The explorer only shows the 'bar' folder with both 'foo' folder and foo.js file hidden.
```
/
|-- bar/
    |-- foo.js
```
2. Go to File does not find **any** of the foo.js files, including bar/foo.js

    <Title>inconsistent file-search-and-replace behavior depending on open files</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.17.2 (1.17.2), b813d12980308015bcd2b3a2f6efa5c810c33ba5
- OS Version: Mac OS 10.13 (17A405)

## Steps to Reproduce

This is about inconsistend behavior when using file-search-and-replace, so you need to perform the same search action twice with different file sets opened.

### PREPARE

Create a couple of text files which contain a couple of lines, and include the same **line** in all of them (e.g. "search me")

### FIRST CASE

1. *close* all open editor windows
2. Hit CMD-SHIFT-H to open file search and replace
3. Search for "search me\n" with regex enabled

RESULT FIRST ROUND: no finds (at least on my machine :)

### SECOND CASE

1. *open any file(s)* containing the line
2. Hit CMD-SHIFT-H to open file search and replace
3. Search for "search me\n" with regex enabled

RESULT SECOND ROUND: the string is found for any file(s) opened in an editor window (and only for those)

const Controller = require('${1:${TM_FRAMEWORK}}').Controller;

now I use `vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider` + `insertText` to workaround.

**Issue -**  I am working with an Angular2 app. I ran the application with **ng serve --o** command which opened my web browser to display the application. I pressed Ctrl + C to terminate the batch job, but instead decided to continue running it. So instead of Typing Y(for yes) I pressed N but still my batch job got terminated. 

Pressing 'N' or 'n' should have let me continue with that existing batch job.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type ng server --o command to run an angular2 app.
2. Press Ctrl + C to terminate the batch job.
3. Press 'N' as input.

    <Title>Sublime text like autocompletion</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.17.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

Is there any way to insert suggestion without opening the suggestion widget. What I want is similar how Sublime Text works. During typing if I press TAB it automatically completes the word based on the words in the current text. Pressing TAB again and again it cyclically completes it, so it goes through the available suggestions without opening the widget.
For example: I have a text "ally automatically", and for the next word I write "aly", then pressing TAB will autocomplete it to "ally", and pressing again TAB completes "automatically", again TAB --&gt; "ally", and so on...
Is there any way to achieve this mechanism in VSCode?</Description>

    <Title>Display total number of found entries after a search</Title>
    <Description>Hello guys,

I've a suggestion and I would like to share with you and get your thoughts on that as well. As vscode is such a versatile code editor, sometimes we also use it as a text editor, since its quite simple, just press Cmd + N and you've a new beauty tab.

But unfortunately, there's one condition on it that I did not seen in Atom, Sublime, or even simple text editors / log stream readers. Its about displaying the total amount of found entries in a search. And as I couldn't find an option to configure it, I'm assuming that its the default behavior of vscode.

It would be nice if users could see the number of found entries on search, but unfortunately it seems that vscode just stops the counting after 999, always displaying a static string "X of 999+ items", instead of this, why not display like "X of 1766 items"?  For example, today, I had to do this twice because I was checking some log files, and I had to open Atom just do to this. And its not the first time for this week. So, maybe other folks also have the same need.

- VSCode Version: 1.16.1
- OS Version: OSX 10.12.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a file with 1000 entries of some string, like " TEST ".
2. Press cmd + f and try to search for " TEST "
3. We can see that a search box is displayed, and it says "X of 999+ items". 
&lt;img width="427" alt="screen shot 2017-10-25 at 4 10 01 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1733227/32018119-39153850-b99f-11e7-8a5e-e68567bfbf8b.png"&gt;

What do you guys thinks about that proposal?

Thanks! :)

    <Title>Keyboard input stops working</Title>
    <Description>Since I installed this version of VSCode, sporadically I have found the keyboard input to stop working. It does not have to do with memory pressure or resource constraints. When it happens, pressing space or enter does nothing. When I switch to another open App (TextEdit, Safari) my keystrokes are accepted. I have found that closing and re-opening the file usually fixes it, if not, I close/restart VSCode.

    <Title>Editor does not auto close quotation marks.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.17.2
- OS Version: MacOS 10.13

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure the system keyboard Layout as US International - PC.

2. Go to the editor and type the key ' and after space key, or when you type the ' key and after press the arrow key, the editor does not auto close the quotes. But when you configure the US keyboard Layout the auto close function works when you type quotes.
I think the Editor should have the same behaviour in both Layouts.
This happens with double quotes too.

    <Title>FR: Terminal on the right side</Title>
    <Description>Hey! I was wondering if there would ever be a possibility to have terminal (and problems, output, debug console) on the right side of the screen. I think that very big amount of people would benefit from that. There are people who have 21:9 screens or similar and vertical space is more important than horizontal space.

Here's my screen, I attach PhpStorm with terminal on the right for comparison:

As in figure. Sublime Text doesn't have this problem. I guess Sublime copy the indent characters of last line to next line, instead of regenerate indent.

Have already set `"editor.autoIndent": false,` in settings.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set the `editor.wordSeparators` option to `"editor.wordSeparators": "`~!@#%^&amp;*()-=+[{]}\\|;:'\",.&lt;&gt;/?"`. This is essentially the default value with `$` removed.
2. Enter this in the editor
```
$this-&gt;stuff
this stuff
and $this thing
```
3. Place the cursor at the beginning of line 1 and press `CMD+D` to highlight the word `$this`. Nothing happens. Further, moving the cursor to anywhere within the word `$this` and pressing `CMD+D` highlights `this`, effectively ignoring the `editor.wordSeparators`.
4. Side note: using the mouse *does* seem to honor the setting.

    <Title>Proposed FileSystemProvider API doesn't support multiple workspace folders per provider</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.18.0-insider (4b01451cea60f32412098735709fddcac567b33d, 2017-10-19T08:25:22.140Z)
- OS Version: Linux x64 4.9.0-4-amd64

I would like to support multiple folders for a given FileSystemProvider in a single workspace.

As an example, a user's code-workspace might be configured as follows:

```
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "uri": "sftp://user1@host1/path/1"
    },
    {
      "uri": "sftp://user2@host2/path/2"
    }
  ]
}
```

I've attempted to accomplish this in a number of different ways, but it seems that the API, as currently implemented, doesn't support this use case.

With the current implementation, it appears that the `authority` passed to `vscode.workspace.registerFileSystemProvider()` must match precisely the scheme of the folder URI in order for the `onFileSystemAccess` activation to be properly dispatched. Only the first provider registered for a given authority will receive dispatches.

Additionally, the `root` field must be a single `vscode.Uri` to match the FileSystemProvider interface, so it is not possible to manually handle dispatching to separate backends in a single FileSystemProvider instance.</Description>

Hello, I was looking at a CSS file `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\out\vs\workbench\workbench.main.css` and It seems that only line 14 all of the color is off. All lines after show as though the are commented out.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\out\vs\workbench\workbench.main.css
2. Look at line 14 (all uncolored).
3. if you add line 15 and start typing, only the comment **green** coloring continues until you do another block comment end "*/"

This will happen also for langauages JavaScript and C#. It was not happening for Clojure nor CoffeeScript. with the same length line.

It is related to #5303

The editor should let the developer know that their is a break between what they are seeing and the true **kind** of data being represented.
A warning pointing to this issue or a general message would suffice. 
Also of consideration, can this be offloading to an async Promise?

    <Title>New vscode icon is horrible</Title>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install fresh VSCode
2. Suffer

Solution: Just use the old one. If the similarity to the visual studio icon is an issue, google "vscode icon" for tons of great alternatives as a source for inspiration.

P.S. Sorry guys, I know this issue is kinda silly but I couldn't resist: new icon looks terrible. Especially the color is bad.</Description>

Using Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), installed fonts (using `apt-get`): `fonts-noto`, `fonts-dejavu`

Using `"editor.fontFamily": "'Noto Mono'"`, `"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14`, notice how the bottom of the letter `g` is clipped:

Using `"editor.fontFamily": "'DejaVu Sans Mono'"`, `"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14`, running `echo ____`, notice how the underscore character `_` is completely invisible:

The problem only happens in the terminal panel but not in the file editing area, despite they're using the same font with the same font size. Adjusting `"terminal.integrated.lineHeight"` has no effect on the clipping issue.</Description>

    <Title>Startup time really long (specially with extensions)</Title>
    <Description>VS Code takes really long to start. I attached screenshots from the startup performance window where it is visible that extensions alone take over 5 seconds. This is a really annoying issue. But even without extensions VS Code takes about 5 secs. This might not seem too much of an issue for you (as i've read in another issue that you consider 5 seconds to be fast) but it still breaks my workflow (considering i'm using extensions) and is really annoying. I'd hate to switch to another Editor, as I've really come to love using code and it's getting better with every update, however performance is a major factor for me. If I just want to open a file quickly and modify or just view it, I have to wait over 10 seconds, which for me is not acceptable.

    <Title>Feature request: Ability to focus single folder in file explorer</Title>
    <Description>While working, would be pretty darn sweet if we could right click a folder and select an option like "Focused Folder/Directory" or something around those lines. 

What this would do is single out this selected directory in your file explorer while collapsing everything else. So you would only see what you are interested in your file explorer (while still having the option to see everything else). This is essentially a filter on the explorer.</Description>

- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone `https://github.com/dlech/vscode-workspace-settings-bug.git` in VS Code
2. Run/debug the extension
3. Open a folder in the extension development host
4. Open any file in this folder (create a new file if needed)
5. Use command palette to run "Show setting1" - it shows an info box with the default value "default"
6. Use the settings editor to change the value of "extension.setting1" for the folder.
7. Run the  "Show setting1" command again - **it still shows "default" instead of the new value**
8. Reload the window
9. Run the  "Show setting1" command again - it now shows the correct value from the folders settings

    <Title>Search and replace in multiple files is not usable with long lines</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.17.2 (b813d12980308015bcd2b3a2f6efa5c810c33ba5, 2017-10-16T13:59:46.104Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.16299
- Extensions: none
---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. I use search and replace in a large markdown-based documentation project 
2. Search and replace UI allows me to pick specific instances of a term to be replaced
3. To the right of the search pane I see a diff view of before and after the replacement
4. Documents are authored with long lines, and many instance of the term to be replaced don't fit in the screen 
5. It is not possible to turn on word wrap in a diff view. Hence the text that I am replacing is not visible without extensive horizontal scrolling, and as a result VS Code is not usable for this scenario.

In comparison, the search and replace experience offered by Atom is much more usable for this scenario, e.g. the text to replace is always visible and in context.</Description>

    <Title>Integrated terminal doesn't recognize project folder location on removable media (WSL Bash)</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.17
- OS Version: Windows 10.0.16299.19 (Win10 1709) 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Mount any removable device (say its drive letter is D) in WSL Bash so you can access it via "/mnt/d".
2. Make sure you use WSL Bash as integrated terminal.
3. Open a project folder on this removable device.
4. The integrated Bash terminal defaults to WSL Bash's user home directory, not to the project folder. This somehow makes sense because it was not possible to mount removable devices in former builds of WSL. However it's been implemented for a while now and since Fall Creators Update this feature is available to a wider public. As a consequence, it's not trivial to use Tasks oder Launch commands because they all operate in the wrong location. 
This fallback solution should be replaced with a check whether the folder is currently accessible in /mnt/ or not. Note that the removable drives stay mounted as long as there exists an open Bash window (globally, not restricted to VS Code terminals) or the user unmounts it.

    <Title>Disable space converstion to tabs</Title>
    <Description>Upon pressing enter, Visual Studio Code will convert `\t\t_____` to `\t\t\t_` (underscore means space) if your tab size is set to 4.  When I say "2 tabs and 5 spaces" I mean "2 tabs and 5 spaces" and I don't want VS Code replacing some of my spaces with tabs.  I am using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment.  There should be an option to prevent VS Code from converting spaces to tabs when determining indentation upon pressing enter.</Description>

    <Title>Minimap out of sync with scrollbar</Title>
    <Description>Not sure if this belongs here but it is issue after all....

Minimap gets out of sync with scroll position. ( left image - u can crearly see, that scrollbar handle is far lower than minimap 'handle' ... )

Also error markers ( in green circle ) are in scope of scrollbar and not minimap ... i usually center minimap view to that red box, get confused for a while and then move to correct place

Can be minimap changed to look similar to Visual Studio (right image) - basically hide 'default' scrollbar and render custom scrollbar with minimap inside?

### Description

Some parts of the window begin to flicker or disappear by hovering over them (see the image below). The application it self doesn't seem be stuck in this moment. Shortcuts and command are working properly. Also writing and saving is no problem, despite that I can't see what I'm writing at this moment. 

It happens often during longer sessions and also sometimes directly after startup. 

In some cases it can be easily by with switching to another application and back, but more often the window has to be reloaded in order to fix this issue. (At least for a short period.)

Currently I'm trying to figure out if it happens only while using specific extensions. Does someone else has similar issues?

I got an issue on macOS Sierra in the integrated terminal, that the character under the cursor gets pushed up. It only happens since I updated from `1.17.0` to `1.17.1`, How far it gets pushed up depends on the line the cursor is in, and from line six on the currently selected character is invisible.

    <Title>Marketplace request times out</Title>
    <Description>Im not sure where to post this issue, but im having trouble reaching marketplace.visualstudio.com both through browsers and extensions in vscode. In vscode, when I try to search for extensions I get this error after a while: "XHR failed:".

I'm not behind any proxy and I can reach all other sites just fine, the problem started about a week ago.
Done the basic things as restarting router, trying on another computer etc.

Here are some additional information:

Pinged these sites:

    <Title>Mac: ENOSPC causes currently editing file content to be deleted</Title>
    <Description>When I'm working in VS Code and my Mac is running on low storage, I've encountered numerous times VS Code complaining about "ENOSPC" and refusing to save a file, which makes sense to me and is expected behavior. Once I close VS Code, however, I find that it had completely deleted the content of the file I was working on. At this point, the only hope I have is to copy the editor content before exiting VS Code, paste it into vim, and save it before rebooting.

I should mention that I have Auto-save turned on.

Ideally, if a "ENOSPC" error occurs, VS Code should not write out empty file contents.

- VSCode Version: Code 1.17.2 (b813d12980308015bcd2b3a2f6efa5c810c33ba5, 2017-10-16T13:47:41.889Z)

(1 theme extensions excluded)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Live dangerously, and work on a file in VS Code with very low space on your OS X boot drive
2. Edit away until an "ENOSPC" error occurs
3. Close VS Code, ignoring its warning of unsaved changes
4. Open the file you were editing in another text editor, use `cat`, or open it in VS Code again once you have freed up some space. It won't matter. Your code is gone for good.

    <Title>Feature Request: Columns and rows selection like Visual Studio</Title>
    <Description>In Visual Studio, and in every text editor like notepad++, I'm able to select rows and columns pressing Shift+Alt and the arrows key. The same behaviour is possible in Visual Studio code pressing Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Arrows but at the end of the editing i want to return to the normal state pressing one of the arrows key. Now in VS Code the only way to exit for this state is pressing esc button. Hope it's clear. ;-) Thanks!</Description>

    <Title>The custom-built PATH shows twice in terminal of vscode.</Title>
    <Description># Basic Information # 
VSCode Version: 1.17.2
 OS Version: macOS 10.13

# Steps to Reproduce : #

1.  I'm working in go, so I configured the running environment of go on my mac.
2. I edit `.bash_profile`,  add the statement `export $PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.(`$(go env GOPATH)` equals to `/Users/Mann/go`)
3. In terminal of vscode, it shows `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/go/bin:/Users/Mann/go/bin:/Users/Mann/go/bin` when I excute the command `echo $PATH`.(`/Users/Mann/go/bin` shows twice)
4. But it shows only once on bash of mac.

    <Title>[Feature Request] feature to update vscode internally</Title>
    <Description>it would be great if we could have update vscode without every time downloading and installing it again and again, maybe through using some gui or even option for automatic update, this is awesome because specially now days minor updates are coming in short periods of time.

    <Title>TypeScript Syntax Highlighting breaks when using ++ inside an if statement</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.17.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

Using the ++ shorthand in an if statement on a TypeScript file breaks the syntax highlighting (fine when preceding the variable).

    <Title>Blurred text on integrated terminal</Title>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install VSCode from .deb package
2. Open Integrated terminal.

Details:

On versions 1.16.x and 1.17.0 the integrated terminal works perfectly fine (except for some resize functionalities). After the 1.17.1 update, I noticed the blurred output. Everything else seems to work as expected. I tried reinstalling but the issue persisted. I tried downgrading to 1.16, and the difference persisted. Also, I used two new VMs, 16.04 and 17.04 respectively. In the 16.04 version, the output is not blurred but it is on 17.04. Thus, this issue only affects 17.04.

- OS Version: Linux x64 4.13.4-200.fc26.x86_64 
- Extensions:  cpptools|ms-|0.13.1
- Steps to Reproduce: Peek a definition on the bottom part of the screen in a C++ file, then close the peek view using shortcut (esc)

I don't know if it is intentional or not, but since the last update, when i peek a definition, it scrolls the file so the function within the peek editor gets on top of the screen.
Not sure if i like this behaviour all that much, as it forces you to scroll back up to see the close button.
The real problem then comes when i close the peek view using a shortcut (esc by default), it doesn't scroll back down, so i lose the line i was working on :

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open default terminal
2. close vscode
3. open vsscode
4. use my extension 'run-as', right click a file (*.bat or something else), click the menu item 'Run as ..', we can see the terminal 'Run As...' is open but **no output**
5. kill terminal 'Run As...'
6. kill terminal 'powershell', we can see another terminal 'Run As...'
7. kill terminal 'Run As...' again
8. use my extension 'run-as', right click a file (*.bat or something else), click the menu item 'Run as ..', we can see the terminal 'Run As...' is open and finally has output
9. kill terminal 'Run As...'
10. use shortcut Ctrl+` to open **a new default terminal, we can see it named 'Run As...'**

But in this situation, it is no problem
1. close default terminal
2. close vscode
3. open vsscode
4. use my extension 'run-as', right click a file (*.bat or something else), click the menu item 'Run as ..', we can see the terminal 'Run As...' is open and has output

**My extension is work correctly in vscode 1.16.**

There's a bug in directory tree while adding a new file.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a project in VSCode.
2. collapse the directory tree panel.
3. click "new file" icon button.
4. expand the directory tree panel.
5. click any file.
6. there will be a weird input box on a random file.

Possible reason:  the input box dose not trigger any blur events, so it never get removed.

    <Description>Very often I need to resize the tools views width and height. I like to have then thin, and keep some views collapsed - like Open Editors - and the File Explorer fully expanded as possible.  Also, I like to keep Terminal with around 20 lines high.

So, every time I start a new VSCode Windows I need to resize everything again. Will be really nice if there is a way to Save my defined windows/views positions and sizing design, and VSCode remember that when it is opened again. </Description>

    <Title>`ext install &lt;name&gt;` doesn't work like it used to</Title>
    <Description>You used to be able to use `ext install &lt;name&gt;` to install an extension. Now it instead just opens the extension pane and searches for the text supplied for `&lt;name&gt;`. That alone isn't a big deal, but you can't search the extensions pane for the name of an extension. 

For example, if I type `ext install gitlens`, it opens extension pane and searches for `gitlens` which returns no results -- even though the actual name of GitLens is `gitlens` as you can see here:

https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/4360c86197728430759ef1d7851ca0edfbd52110/package.json#L1-L15

As an aside, the only reason I ended up having the `displayName` being what it is, was because of poor searching. When it was just called *GitLens*, you couldn't find it when searching for `git` or `lens` or any other keywords. With any luck that would also be wonderful to have fixed -- because I'd love to set its `displayName` back to just *GitLens* and not have to *SEO* pack it.

    <Title>simpleFindWidget overlays part HTML webview, causing dead zone in upper-right</Title>
    <Description>The recent release of 1.17.1 introduced a new "dead zone", an un-clickable area near the upper-right corner of the HTML preview / webview.  The actual `&lt;webview&gt;` is obscured by a `&lt;div class="simple-find-part-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="simple-find-part"&gt;...` that appears in the DOM just prior to it.

Note that this breaks ALL existing extensions that place UI controls in the upper-right of an HTML panel, so I would love to see an urgent fix for this.

I created a "reduced case" extension to test this, [source on GitHub here](https://github.com/emackey/browser-tester).  This extension contributes a single command called `Hello World`, that opens an HTML preview with a giant button in the upper-right.  This button turns green when hovered and orange when clicked.  The top line of the button is un-clickable and un-hoverable at all times.  Real extensions use smaller buttons, and those are completely obscured by this.

Here's my reduced-case extension being debugged.  You can see that `simple-find-part-wrapper` is completely obscuring part of the `webview`, making the extension's content unreachable.

5. Now, type this in src/index.js

    you will fail to transpile!

4. Build. The program asks to configure default build task. If you use the node task, it'll work. My tasks.json is like this however.
    ```
    {
        // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
        // for the documentation about the tasks.json format

                "problemMatcher": [
                    "$eslint-compact"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

Expected: With the NVDA screen reader running, vscode's output window is readable.

Actual: There's no text whatsoever visible with NVDA. However, if I OCR the whole window, text is visible in the console.
I've reproduced this with a python project with custom tasks.json as well.

Steps to Reproduce:

_This is an issue when using multiple screens and with two different environments on the same machine (laptop)._

1. Load Code having one multi screen orientation (e.g. at home I use my laptop with a screen connected above my laptop screen)
2. Move Code to "other" screen and Close.
3. Change screen orientations (at work I have 2 additional screens to the left of the laptop screen)
4. Open Code.

Code now appears to the left of my left most screen.  I have to use Alt+Space then M and the arrow keys to move the screen right so that it appears on my left most screen.  i.e.  I'm assuming the top left coordinate that is saved is a -ve value, hence why I can't see the screen.

I hope that makes sense.

    <Title>Add filename, line &amp; column information in EvaluateArguments with 'hover' context</Title>
    <Description>I'm implementing a z80 debugger, for example:
```
162A 5E       ld e, (hl)
162B 19       add hl, de
```

Hovering over `(hl)` in the first line should have more information than hovering over the `hl` in the second line - however, obviously the brackets are treated as a word boundary and don't get include in the EvaluateRequest.

Given the line &amp; col information I could extract additional information. For (hl), for example, I could show the contents of the memory address pointed to by the HL register.

The Stable version icon is not shown correctly.

But when it comes to file icons (when they're opened by the editor by default), the stable version looks better:

 But then, this happens again...

When comparing file and switch to another tab and return to comparison tab, the scroll back to the beginning. This is very annoying. 

Is there any setting to stop this?

    <Title>Snippets should have custom transforms</Title>
    <Description>Snippets currently have a facility to transform input in predefined ways.

But those predefined ways are very limited.

* upcase
* downcase
* capitalize

What I would like to achieve is something more custom.

This is portion of a bigger snippet code that I am trying to work as smoothly as possible.

```
.ofType&lt;GetLogicalSwitchesSearchAction&gt;(GET_LOGICAL_SWITCHES_SEARCH_ACTION)
```

Right now I have to type the text twice. But if there is a way one could throw in custom logic, then I could simply type `GetLogicalSwitchesSearchAction` once and the 2nd part should intelligently fill up `GET_LOGICAL_SWITCHES_SEARCH_ACTION`.

Hence creating this issue to track this request for custom logic in snippets.</Description>

Yesterday; I updated VS Code then my integrated terminal messed up.

&lt;img width="974" alt="screen shot 2017-10-09 at 7 45 50 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374985/31343900-f2fb08b2-acc5-11e7-94c4-aebde573702d.png"&gt;

As you can see i'm using the powerline fonts; and there seems to be a lot of extra 'padding' there between everything which wasn't there before.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.18 Insiders
- OS Version:  OSX 10.12.6 Sierra

Steps to reproduce: Activate Zen Mode - Cmd K + Z

At the moment, in order to achieve the desired visual effect, I have to use the `split editor` feature and open a dummy file. It would be really good if there was a configurable way of getting the Zen Mode option to center/left pad the display.

- This issue only occurred after I upgrade to High Sierra last night. It worked fine on Sierra.
- This issue occurs occasionally, not always.
- Waiting for a while and it came back to normal. then it goes nut again. back and forth. (sometimes minimize and restore the window helps. maybe it triggers a re-render. but I think it's more like just luck)
- Rebooting the computer didn't solve the problem.
- Thought might be problem with electron. but ATOM behaves normal.
- I installed latest node &amp; npm after upgrading. All my projects are working. So runtime should be fine.

This could be an individual case. I don't know if anyone else had the same problem. Hope there's a fix other than reinstalling the OS.</Description>

    <Title>Named workspaces + `window.title`</Title>
    <Description>Hi,

It would be awesome if we have the ability to name our workspaces. And subsequently be able to use them in `window.title` setting.

Like this:

```
{
  "settings": {
    "workspace.Name": "ui-ng"
    "window.title": "${workspaceName}${separator}${activeEditorMedium}${separator}${dirty}"
  }
}
```

And the same workspace names should be used to open recent workspaces in vscode.</Description>

    <Title>Two finger scroll becomes laggy on Surface Book when one or more plug-in's are enabled</Title>
    <Description>I'm having a scroll-lag issue in Visual Code when using two-finger scrolling on a Surface Book (i7 model) when one or more plug in is enabled.  The more plug-ins I enabled, the greater the lag.   

The lag is seen when following these steps:

1. Scroll down some way in a large piece of code (say 200 lines)
2. Place two fingers at the lower side of the track pad
3. Slide two fingers up 
4. The Visual Code UI will not slide immediately
5. There is a lag and then the sliding begins and snap scrolls

The performance of two finger scroll on Chrome or Edge is far superior.  I searched the usual places on the internet to see if someone else had this issue, but it seems two-finger scrolling has had a number of issues over the years.  I have to rule out the device itself because it works perfectly in other apps that support smooth scrolling.

Usually, I need to navigate with Ctrl+p and Ctrl+n instead of UpArrow and DownArrow. How can I bind it in Reference Search popup?

I think the collapse should open so you can type and see the file name you are about to create.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Write a JavaScript JsDoc comment on a class member function with a parameter.
2. Edit the documentation of the param to make it optional with a default value.  When typing the equals sign, without having typed the closing brace first, vs code will often hang and need to be restarted.

E.x.
```
class Test {
    /**
     * Some test documentation
     * @async
     * 
     * @param {string} [configFile= - The absolute path of the module's configuration file.
     * @returns {Promise}
     */
    parseModuleConfig(config) {
        return config + 1;
    }
}
```

When typing the **=** in the above comment, vs code hangs.

- give the editor section a small with, and close the window
- start with a empty window
- add an empty folder with 'Add workspace folder'
- open the terminal. It will open with small width, don't resize yet, but type `ls`
- resize the terminal to get more width
- context stays small

Go to Bracket will jump the cursor to the matching bracket but not the view when the matching bracket is not on screen. 
One can move cursor with the arrow keys after jumping to matching bracket and the view would jump too.
Previous vscode versions would "scroll" to the matching bracket automatically.
Is this on purpose in the latest vscode version, seems like a bug.

    <Title>Custom aliases for quick open shortcuts (view, task, debug, etc)</Title>
    <Description>I use the quick open shortcuts pretty often, and I want them to be accessible but don't want to come up with new shortcuts for all of them. In the terminal I usually assign one or two letter shortcuts to commands that I use often, so it would be awesome if I could customize the command palette in the same way.

For example, I might want to type `db` to get a list of debug configs instead of `debug`, or `t` for tasks.

```
"workbench.quickOpen.aliases": {
  "db": "debug ",
  "t": "task ",
  // or maybe symbols
  "!": "view ",
  // or for the command palette beyond the existing shortcuts
  "x": "&gt;extensions:"

The native terminal does do this and this does work on Windows for our integrated terminal.

Testing #34821.

When openFIles and openFolders are both set to true, both files / folders are pickable.

This is the same behavior as when both are false. One of them should error out I think.

Maybe a better approach is to rename the two options to showFiles and showFolders, both default to true.

Both true -&gt; show all
Only showFiles false -&gt; show folders only, similarly for showFolders
When both are false -&gt; error out

And currently the word "open" is overloaded with two different meanings in the API, as openLabel and openFiles are totally different. Might cause some confusion.</Description>

    <Title>VS Code unusable on Mac with large projects</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.16.1 (1.16.1)
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195)

Opening a large project in VS Code on Mac causes other in-no-way-related programs to crash, break, or behave otherwise unexpectedly. Examples include Safari and Chrome failing to load anything, Terminal failing to even show a basic prompt, and even VS Code's Git extension failing to initialize. VS Code continues to work, until you try to save, at which point it fails to do so. Makes it unworkable for large projects.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create project with large number of files. My project currently has 20k+ files (that does not include npm modules BUT it does include build artifacts).
2. Observe (in Activity Monitor for example) a high thread count. It currently floats around 660 threads for me. If using Activity Monitor, observe the number of open files by CodeHelper (gets up to around 9k before crashing the log.)
3. Observe other programs failing. This includes basically every program -- browsers failing to load despite having internet, other IDEs, Terminal, Chrome extensions, even VS Code's Git extension fails.

I have a problem with the multiline problemsMatcher and word wrapped results in the terminal console. 

When I integrate jasmine error reports to vscode "problems" tab and my vscode window is small, the reported error lines are cut at the visual width of the terminal window. Because multiline pattern matching works line by line, those wrapped lines doesn't contains whole information and  are not consistent any more with my pattern matching regex expressions. 

Is there any way to disable word wrapping in the terminal window or do you have any other workaround maybe ? 

I tested with two different terminals (Git Bash and win. PowerShell), because both have the same behavior I think the wrapping is at the vscode side ?   
  
Steps to Reproduce:

I describe whole integration between jasmine and vscode in [this blog article](http://bisaga.com/blog/programming/testing-typescript-node-app-with-jasmine/) 

1. create project with jasmine tests, run jasmine in the terminal successfully, then 
2. create task with the content:

        }            
            
    ]
}
3. run the task with maximized size of the terminal window , pattern matcher does recognize errors and create problem in the problems tab
An error line (where the last regex pattern looks for file, line and column) looks like: 

`
        at UserContext.it (c:\Bisaga\Workspaces\learning\mytest\spec\myapi-spec.ts:16:32) 
`

4. run the task with very narrow size of the terminal window, pattern matcher does not recognize errors any more because the error line reported from the jasmine is now in 3 lines ...
An error line from jasmine is now in the 3 lines instead of the one : 

```
        at UserContext.it (c:\Bisaga\Worksp
aces\learning\mytest\spec\myapi-spec.ts:16:
32)
```

    <Title>[Feature Request] - Disable and Enabling Extensions</Title>
    <Description>Visual Studio Code x64
Version: 1.16.1

**What is happening:**
I notice that when we "Disable (Always)" an extension, when I want to enable it again I can't just enable for that workspace, I need to enable Always again. 

**What I want**
I can  "Disable (Always)"  for the default behavior, but Should let I "Enable (Workspace)". 

**Why?**
It's good to have some plugins that is disabled by default and I enable only when I need without the needing of enable it always.

**Thank you**</Description>

There is a stack overflow page which suggests that this functionality did once exist in Code, but it was taken out. If that's true, what was the reason?</Description>

A background process `/usr/share/code/code /usr/share/code/resources/app/out/bootstrap --type=searchService` always takes a whole CPU core.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a node project created by vue-cli
2. one `Code` process takes a whole CPU core and creates six subprocesses running `find -L . -type f`
3. after closing the Code, these subprocesses take all my four CPU cores for about one minute before exit

    <Title>CSS and SCSS indentation using tabs is off with lines with the color decorator</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.16.1
- OS Version: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Gnome

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Start a blank file `/tmp/foo.css/`
2. Paste this code in there:

```css
/* I've intentionally indented with 2 spaces */
.foo {
  padding: 10px;
  color: #123;
}
```

3. Go to the bottom right and click the tab size box and select "Convert indentation to Tabs".
4. The `color` line has slightly different indentation.

Believe me, I prefer spaces for indentation, but I'm on a couple code bases where the team has chosen tabs. And this is a weird annoyance.

    <Title>[Feature Request] Different way to complete with tab (YCM style)</Title>
    <Description>## Before I start
Hello.

VS Code is great software, and i really like how it grows over time, so I want to improve the experience of using it.

Previously I used Vim a lot, because at work it is my only option, but at home for hobbies I use VS Code, and when I program in C, at my work I use YouCompleteMe (YCM) plugin for `tab` completions, and I really like the way it works. 

## Touch typing

The main thing is that I use all my 10 fingers to write code, and rarelly move hands from home row, because vim, _you know_, has `hjkl` and other ways to navigate in code. So first thing was to install vim-extension to VS Code, to stop using arrow keys, and it works well. But tab completion still forces me to use arrows.

How it works in Vim: I select from the list using the `tab` button and I confirm the completion by simply continuing typing. Therefore, my hands never leave the home row.

The way it works in VS Code: `tab` button completes the completion and closes popup, And arrow keys are just navigate within the list and not confirm anything. So I need to navigate in list with arrow keys (and leave home row) then press `tab` for completion. In fact it is way faster just to type most things by hand just looking at the popup for reference. And it is frustrating after long way of programming in vim.

## So what do _you_ want?
All I want is an option in settings to change `tab` key behavior to something like (or close to) YCM style. 
The behavior itself can be described like so:
  1. Start typing (`std::` for example)
  2. Completion popup is displayed (or invoked by `tab`)
  3. Press the `tab` and completion is done, but popup isn't closed
  4. Press tab again, and next item in popup list replaces previous completion
  5. Press tab until you will be satisfied with your completed text
  6. Continue typing, popup is closed (unless you folow the completion hint from popup)

That's how (mostly) it works in such plugins like YouCompleteMe, Supertab in Vim. You can try this plugins for better understanding of what i mean. And it is comfortable because you don't need arrow keys at all.

## P.S:
Previously (before Vim) I used Visual Studio for C++ programming, and when I swithced to YCM's completion system I noticed a great boost of writing speed. YCM has it's own plugin in the marketplace, but it uses standard `tab` behavior, which makes it little less useful an makes me little less productive.

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but since upgrading to v1.16 I've noticed that the Go to Bracket keybinding will mark the matching bracket but it does not page down to that bracket.  I've checked shortcut settings and it is indeed listed as a shortcut.  I just updated to v1.16.1 but the problem still persists.  If it is not a bug and instead some sort of setting I need to change please let me know.

---

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Highlight a curly bracket then hit Ctrl+Shift+\ 
2.  Typically the page would jump to the matching bracket and in my case it no longer does.

Thanks for the help.

I know there's extension that allow to make that, but the native extension working with the great TSServer running will be amazing for that !
Also, the diagnostic logic of typescript already proprose to import something with the bulblight after we type the complete name of the exported thing, and it works like a charm with baseUrl and already imported section. Why don't propose an option to autoimport after hitting the completion key on the intellisense window ?</Description>

- VSCode Version: all

I have a lot of snippets for my projects and I often use variables.
`TM_FILEPATH` - it's good, but sometimes project has very long path, something like:
`/home/user/Documents/work/project1/frontEnd/bestUi/src/component/modal/utils/view.js`
My root folder in vsCode is `bestUi` I don't need to print or use all path, just path from root-folder to file:
`/bestUi/src/component/modal/utils/view.js`,
My proposal is to add new variable, called `TM_FILEPATH_RELATIVE`, which return, only path from root-folder to file.
If this proposal is being interesting for community, I can implement it, added test for that, add support for multi root-folders and so on,
Just one question, I cannot understand - Where is vsCode saving information about root folder of project?
Thanks a lot for all discussions.</Description>

Thanks, VsCode team for the awesome 1.16.1 Update... but I think there is more room for improvement,
If there is an option to save the workspace will be useful... I use 2 integrated terminals for my work. I  have to start it manually each time it gets back to work. if there is an option to save these all as a project it would be easier and fun to work. I feel language support more than JS is not up to the mark. but thanks to plugins which definitely fills the gap, But an integrated solution is more appreciated

- OS Version: macOS 10.13 Beta (17A362a)


Steps to Reproduce:

1. Paste the following command into the integrated terminal:
`python -c 'print ("\x1b[31m0123456789\x1b[0m")*9`
This prints the string [RED]0123456789[RESET] nine times, followed by a newline.

2. Resize the VSCode window so that the window half clips one of the red characters, and run it again.


Issues:

The terminal output does not wrap the partially-clipped character; it is possible to resize the window so that the final character essentially disappears.

Additionally, double-clicking a line of text to select it causes the line below to become highlighted instead.

Ideally, previously rendered text would wrap dynamically as the window was resized but this is not the case.

The rendering processes will each take up ~40% CPU just idling. During startup it will max the CPU the entire time starting, it takes upto 2 minutes for the UI to finally show. After that it keeps the CPU pinned at 60-100% usage doing literally nothing.

Server is a fresh install of 2k12 R2 and VSCode is a fresh install with no extensions. 
Happens on both 32bit and 64bit builds.</Description>

When initially start VSCode with the terminal view visible, it has sizing issues:
- Note the prompt goes over two lines
- Note the gray area on the right

- pressing enter fixes the rendering of the prompt
- the gray area on the right stays, also when resizing VSCode

Steps to Reproduce:

1. VS Code crashes after latest upgrade. It has crashed 2 times in 10 minutes. I'm working on a angularJs project. The workflow is as follow
 - in first terminal (powershell) start TS with watch : &gt;&gt;tsc -w
 - in second terminal (powershell) start live server: &gt;&gt;live-server

After a little while VS Code will crash.
**Work around**:  Launch external shells and run the commands there. After doing this I have not seen any crash.

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;

# Description
**EDITED 09/13**:  Updated this morning and terminal looks beautiful again! 🥇  What changed?
I noticed after updating **yesterday** that the integrated terminal's font appears quite different than it used to.  Were there commits merged that are related to this part of VSCODE?

Unfortunately, I don't have a screen shot handy of how it used to look, but i've included how it currently looks.

Thank you in advance.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a project with many folders (you should be able to scroll in the sidebar file explorer). Maybe expand some folders and have some colorful file icons enabled, it will help recognizing the effect described below.
2. In the sidebar file explorer, right-click any of the upper folders and click "New File" or "New Folder".
3. Now start scrolling down until the input for the new file name disappears from the viewport.
4. Scroll up again: The input is gone.

   Instead, all kinds of crazy stuff will happen to the file tree. Keep scrolling up and down, try different scrolling speeds. You will notice files and folders randomly disappearing and re-appearing, or changing order — never in your sight, only in parts of the file tree you're just about to scroll to.

   It even happened to me that I clicked on a `.gitignore` file but an `.editorconfig` file was opened instead. I scrolled down and up again, and there actually *was* an `.editorconfig` which must have been disappeared before.

I was able to reproduce this bug with and without extensions and on two different machines, both running macOS Sierra.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Take the setup here: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/tree/master/examples/fork-ts-checker
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Observe lack of clickability on errors:

![screenshot 2017-09-12 06 12 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1010525/30310016-40e1325e-9786-11e7-858d-7f5579deae38.png)

The reason for this is the colour change that the [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) produces between the path ("...fileWithError.ts") and the line number / column number ("(2:7)")

You can work around this by supplying a custom formatter to fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin; see here: https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2017/09/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin-code.html

However, I wonder if VS Code should be able to cope with these colour changes and preserve "clickability".  What do you think?

1. Annotate a method with a doc comment containing markdown.

2. Hover the method to observe rendered markdown in a hover tip.

3. Write some code that invokes the method. When you open parentheses a hover tip will appear containing the same markdown _unrendered_.

    <Title>Keyboard layout compatibility</Title>
    <Description>_From @pujiaxun on August 30, 2017 2:54_

- VSCode Version: 1.15.1 
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.6  


I am using an simplified Chinese input method. And this seems to change the keyboard layout, which makes a few keybindings failed.

For example:

When **ABC(English)** input method:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "cmd+v",
        "command": "editor.action.clipboardPasteAction",
        "when": "editorTextFocus &amp;&amp; !editorReadonly"
    },
  {
        "key": "cmd+/",
        "command": "editor.action.commentLine",
        "when": "editorTextFocus &amp;&amp; !editorReadonly"
  }
]
```

When **Simplified Chinese** input method:
```json
[
    {
        "key": "cmd+v",
        "command": "editor.action.clipboardPasteAction",
        "when": "editorTextFocus &amp;&amp; !editorReadonly"
    }
]
```

**The `cmd+/` disappeared!**

Finally I find this:

```json
    {
        "key": "cmd+[Slash]",
        "command": "editor.action.commentLine",
        "when": "editorTextFocus &amp;&amp; !editorReadonly"
    }
```

I wonder whether I can toggle a switch to change the keybindings from `/` to `[Slash]`, from `,` to `[Comma]`, and so on?

Thank you!

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In the display settings you should have two monitors in this order: 1, 2.
2. Set the 2nd monitor the main one.
3. "Restore" the window (make it not full-size) and place it on the 1st monitor.
4. Close VSCode.
5. Set the 1st monitor the main one.
6. Open VSCode.

In the taskbar there is an active element of VSCode, but clicking on it or Alt+Tab'ing does not make the VSCode visible. Clicking on the taskbar item prompts me with the animation that the window is to the left of the 1st monitor, beyond visibility.

The problem will not be reproduced if you perform the same actions with the 2nd monitor.

The problem will be fixed if you set back the 2nd monitor the main one and move the window to it. Of course, the problem will also be fixed if you clear the `%APPDATA%\Code` folder.

## 实际使用中，就可能出现
### 1. 用相同的编码打开所有文件
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15274374/30243082-0981ffe4-95d5-11e7-879f-148f8eec1622.png)

## 一般在编码代码时，`bat`文件使用windows默认的编码（`ANSI`）中文（`GB2312`/`GBK`/`GB18030`），而`Javascript`使用`utf8`，这样才方便使用。

### 建议增加对如下配置方式的支持

    <Title>Option to keep documentContentProvider alive when tab is changed</Title>
    <Description>We have very bad feedback about VSCode + PIO Home (@platformio). PIO Home is React.JS based application which we load using `iframe`. It depends on a server backend and needs 1-2sec to be started.

See related issue with detailed description for this problem: https://github.com/platformio/platformio-vscode-ide/issues/32

I've already received a feedback from @Tyriar / @mjbvz that it's a normal behavior of VSCode.

We propose our extensions of PlatformIO IDE for Atom and VSCode. We don't have any problems with Atom, it allows us to decide what to do with an internal content provider.

------

So, how about to have an option for `vscode.workspace.registerTextDocumentContentProvider` where we can explain VSCode to don't kill our documentContentProvider when a tab is changed?</Description>

I believe this is a recent regression:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open any source file with matching brackets far away from each other so one of them is outside the visible lines
2. jump to the matching bracket (editor.action.jumpToBracket)
3. cursor moves to the matching bracket correctly, but it's not outside the visible lines (editor does not auto-scroll to keep cursor visible as expected)

Just installed last update, and PHP code colors beacame strange with an unchanged file,
so i made a test editing a simple php file..
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a php file
2. insert following code
```
&lt;?php
// Yii::app()-&gt;clientScript-&gt;registerScriptFile(Yii::app()-&gt;baseUrl . '/js/index.js', CClientScript::POS_HEAD);
// Yii::app()-&gt;clientScript-&gt;registerCssFile(Yii::app()-&gt;baseUrl . '/css/index.css');
?&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/index.css" /&gt;

&lt;?php

if ($this-&gt;user-&gt;type=='candidat') {
	?&gt;
	&lt;div class="row main-panel"&gt;

		&lt;div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4" id="profileBloc"&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-address-card-o"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mon profil&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;a href="/profile"&gt;
			&lt;div class="panel"&gt;
				
				&lt;div class="picture"&gt;
					&lt;?php
					if (file_exists("file/pics/" . $this-&gt;user-&gt;primaryKey . ".jpg"))
						$url = '/thumb/get/id/' .$this-&gt;user-&gt;primaryKey . '?method=cut&amp;w=175&amp;h=225';
					else 
						$url = '/images/icone_compte_2.png';
					?&gt;
					&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="&lt;?= $url ?&gt;" id="thumb_1" &gt; 
				&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div class="info"&gt;
					&lt;?php 
					if (!$this-&gt;user-&gt;nom) {
						?&gt;
						&lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;
							Les information de votre profil n'ont pas encore été complétées
						&lt;/div&gt;

I have the same problem with NFS mounted directories etc. In Atom the app asks for my username and password to save, but VS Code just gives this error. Would it be possible to have the Atom's functionality in VS Code as well? Would be superb.

EDIT: Wanted to add that the reason I'd like to have this functionality is that I don't like (and its not recommended) to run VS Code as root. So the result is that any file that needs root access to edit is uneditable with VS Code.</Description>

As of the latest update, Syntax Highlight breaks any time I have a `?&gt;` after a `{`.
Looks like VScode doesnt know to switch back to HTML highlighting.
This is with all plugins disabled.
PS: The issue is only with syntax highlighting. If I save the file, I don't get any "Problems".

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new .php file.
2. Start typing some code.
3. Put a `?&gt;` tag after a `{`
4. Watch the colors disappear!

    <Title>Load/download extension using extensions.json adjacent to settings.json </Title>
    <Description>I think it makes sense to move extensions to extensions.json for following advantages.

- Easy to share and sync
- Workspace specific extensions
- Allow users to create extensions collection which user can enable or disable as collection
e.g csharp collection in extensions.json file will have on csharp related extensions and can be disabled in workspace extensions.json so unnecessary extensions are not loaded

- VSCode Version: 1.15.1, Commit 41abd2
- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Insert the following code snippet to `latex.json` (which is where user's tex snippet goes)
Or by clicking `File` -&gt; `Preferences`-&gt;`User Snippets` and search `tex`.
```
	"Input a multiline eqn": {
		"prefix": "eqnmultiline",
		"body": [
			"\\[",
			"\t\\begin{array}{lcl}",
			"\t\t ${1:foo} &amp; = &amp; ${2:foo} \\\\",
			"\t\t &amp; = &amp; ${3:foo} \\\\",
			"\t\t &amp; = &amp; ${4:foo} \\\\",
			"\t\\end{array}",
			"\\]",
			"$0"
		],
		"description": "Input a multiline eqn"
	}

```
2. In a demo.tex, type `eqnmultiline` which will insert a code snippet as follows:
```
   \[
        \begin{array}{lcl}
             foo &amp; = &amp; foo \
             &amp; = &amp; foo \
             &amp; = &amp; foo \
        \end{array}
    \]
```
And I'm expecting a `\\` at the end of the three foo lines, which I use `\\\\` to escape. But the result is one `\`  at each line. 
[Snippet Grammer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_grammar) says using `\` to escape `\`. So I'm wondering if this is a bug.

1. Save `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ghostscript_Tiger.svg` and open in VSC.
2. Ensure settings `"editor.selectionHighlight": true` &lt;ins datetime="2017-09-12T14:18:59+02"&gt;and `"editor.fontLigatures": true`&lt;/ins&gt;
3. Select entire document.
4. Invoke `&gt;Join Lines`.
5. If lines are wrapped, invoke `&gt;Toggle word wrap` .
6. Select `0` (zero, or any other digit).

## Actual behavior:

Editor **completely frozen** (i.e. does not react for any kind of input) **for circa 15 seconds**.
After highlights appear editor works normally again.

## Expected behavior: 

No freeze.
Would not mind missing or delayed highlights.

## Notes:

Quite OK with wrapped lines.

    <Title>Fast tasks cause the task output terminal to automatically clear &amp; close in tasks.json version 2.0.0</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;
## System Information:
&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.15.1
- OS Version: Debian 9.1 (Stretch)
&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;
 - Reproduces without extensions: Yes

**Note:** I've attempted to reproduce this issue on Windows, but have been unable to do so, I'm not sure if it's because executing the command takes longer on Windows or if its because the issue simply isn't present on Windows.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new workspace
1. Create a tasks.json with the following contents (note that it's version 2.0.0)
	```
	{
		// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
		// for the documentation about the tasks.json format
		"version": "2.0.0",
		"tasks": [
			{
				"taskName": "test",
				"type": "shell",
				"command": "echo hello world; sleep 1",
				"group": {
					"kind": "test",
					"isDefault": true
				}
			}
		]
	}
	```
1. Run the test test several times, note how the terminal remains visible after the task has completed, and contains the following message: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5873790/30079779-550467f6-924f-11e7-9531-64892f51878b.png)
1. Remove the sleep portion of the command so that the command line of tasks.json reads as follows:
`"command": "echo hello world"`
1. Run the test task several times, note that if you still had the terminal open from the previous step, that it gets automatically closed after the task completes. The terminal re-opens every time the new version of the command is run, and is automatically closed afterwards. The following is all that is printed (note that the "Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it" message is not displayed)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5873790/30079964-0cba22b4-9250-11e7-931e-7f90ab6d62c3.png)

## Additional Info
This is actually a combination of two parts of the same issue, the first being that in tasks.json version 2.0.0 a task which terminates too quickly will automatically clear and close the tasks output terminal. In tasks.json version 0.1.0, the expected behavior (of the task output terminal remaining open) occurs regardless of whether or not the task completes extremely quickly.

I have also included a [zip archive](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/1278719/example.zip) containing two versions of an example workspaces where this problem is present; the workspaces contain the source code for a basic "Hello World" program, a makefile to build it, and the appropriate tasks.json. The `tasks-new` workspace uses tasks.json version 2.0.0 whereas 'tasks-legacy' uses tasks.json version 0.1.0. The behavior I've experienced in these workspaces is as follows:

| Workspace 	| Build Command (In a clean workspace) 	| Build Command (When the program has already been compiled) 	| Test Command 	| Test Command (When the example program has been built with the sleep(1) line enabled) 	|
|--------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| tasks-legacy 	| Build output is displayed, the terminal remains open 	| "make: Nothing to be done for 'build'." is displayed, the terminal remains open 	| "[0] './bin/a.out'" is displayed, the terminal remains open 	| "[0] './bin/a.out'" is displayed, the terminal remains open 	|
| tasks-new 	| Build output is displayed, the terminal remains open, "Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it." message is displayed 	| "make: Nothing to be done for 'build'." is displayed, the terminal is closed when the task completes 	| "[0] './bin/a.out'" is displayed, the terminal is closed when the task completes 	| "[0] './bin/a.out'" is displayed, the terminal remains open, "Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it." message is displayed 	|

    <Title>Text is pasted into integrated terminal instead of search box</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.15.1 64-bit
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Copy some text to clipboard
2. Go to integrated terminal (powershell in my case)
3. Open search box (ctrl-f)
4. Paste copied text into search box.

Behavior:
![pasting-in-terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9638275/30054875-dd9b3652-922d-11e7-824d-2d01177a28a7.gif)

Text is pasted into terminal instead of terminal search box, or in both places. Right-click on Find field in the box to paste from context menu also pastes the text into terminal, even without explicitly selecting Paste from context menu. This changes depending on focus, sometimes closing and opening search box changes behavior slightly, but it still appears in one or other way.

2. Start &gt; Open Folder &gt; Select Folder
3. No files appear in file tree except for the "Welcome" menu.
4. This appears to happen when I delete the main tree folder and then use a USB to copy + paste a new folder from the USB to same directory and rename it to the original main tree directory name.  

I've ignored this issue long enough - it's really hit and miss. I have to reload/switch folders in the application 5-10 times before it finally appears. I've uninstalled/disabled all extensions. I've went the route of setting restoreWindows to none and I'm still getting the same issue.

I've Googled this and can't find anything. I also have the same issue on a separate computer. Anyone have any suggestions?

Sometimes files opens both as they were named, like filename.h, and sometimes they **also** open as FILENAME.H in the tab. Having same file opened twice causes all types of issues. 
Most probably , this shows up sometimes/always when using "find in files" or "replace in files"
( I can't promise I've noticed all times it has happened. )

This on a project stored on a shared disk on the Cubestation.

    <Title>Snippets: final tab stop doesn't get added if there are no placeholders in the snippet</Title>
    <Description>Take the below 2 examples of html snippets. The first one has a placeholder, the second doesn't.
The Snippet parser adds a final tab stop for the first snippet, but not for the second.


```
{
	"Sample": {
		"prefix": "list1",
		"body": [
			"&lt;ul class=${1:hello}&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
		]
	},
	"Sample2": {
		"prefix": "list2",
		"body": [
			"&lt;ul class=${1}&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
		]
	}
}
```

This is due to : https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c0018cf640c82ab12ec60c9052da8ea66e748549/src/vs/editor/contrib/snippet/browser/snippetParser.ts#L487

This provides inconsistencies when authoring snippets.
Emmet especially assumes the editor will add the final tab stop and so doesn't do it itself.

    <Title>Allow regular expression for CompletionItemProvider triggerCharacters</Title>
    <Description>**Problem**
For issues like #23962, we want to trigger suggestions when the user types the `'` in:

```js
import _ from '
```

Registering the TS completion provider with `'` as a trigger character currently results in the completion provider being shown too often and in unexpected placed

**Proposal**
Allow triggerCharacters to use regular expressions. This regular expression would be run against the proceeding text on the line. In the above case, the completion item provider would use a regular expression like `/from\s+['"]$/` and be run against: `import _ from '`

    <Title>Shortkeys - Add a "when clause" for "focus is in panel"</Title>
    <Description>Hi all, I'm using vscode (1.15.1) for a few days and I've a very good impression about it ! 
However, I'm writing a simple extension and playing with interactive js shell (debug console) and I missed a keyboard shortcut to jump between text editor and panel.
The solution given in [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42796887/switch-focus-between-editor-and-integrated-terminal-in-visual-studio-code) is great for swapping between **integrated terminal** and code editor, but here I'm not using terminal, but debug console.

So I tried something very similar (using `ctrl+e` (but no matters)) and tried to add 2 rules like that :


    {
        "key": "ctrl+e",
        "command": "workbench.action.focusPanel",
        "when": "editorTextFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+e",
        "command": "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup",
        "when": "!editorTextFocus"
    }


But this doesn't work: I can focus from the text edition to the panel, but I can't focus back. I figured out after some tests that when the focus is in panel, `editorTextFocus` is still true (in contrary to `terminalFocus`).

So, to find a solution to my problem, I need a *when clause* that let me know whether the focus is on panel or not. As far as I can see in vscode'code, I can't find any `RawContextKey` that looks like that.

Did I missed something ? (I hope I didn't opened an issue for nothing)

    <Title>Feature Request: Cursor should automatically jump to next line when "Comment line" shortcut key is held</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

This is a Feature Request.

Currently, Holding the shortcut key to "Comment Line" does nothing. So, If I want to comment multiple consecutive lines, I have to first select all those lines/add cursors and then comment them. This behaviour is different than most IDEs and text editors and a teensy bit annoying. 

As holding down "Comment Line" shortcut(Ctrl + "/")  currently does nothing. My suggestion is to add a system so if the shortcut is held for more than 2-3 seconds(Configurable) the cursor will jump to next line and comment it and keep doing that until you've released the shortcut keys. 

This behaviour is similar to other IDEs and editors making it easier for people coming from other IDEs/editors to adapt vscode and also makes better use of shortcut. 

If this sounds like a reasonable request, I would absolutely love to work on it.

    <Title>Debug breakpoint not showing as resolved nor hit in multi root workspace</Title>
    <Description>Steps to Reproduce (macOS):

1. generate an extension and open it as folder and debug a little bit (add breakpoints)
2. generate another extension and drop this folder into the explorer to create a multi root workspace
3. add a breakpoint into the second extension (it shows up as unresolved for me)
4. start the extension and make sure the breakpoint code is executed
5. the breakpoint now turns into a resolved breakpoint but only the second invocation makes it stop there

    <Title>Automatically enable KeyRepeat on MacOS</Title>
    <Description>I am crossposting this issue from https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1983 at the request of @jpoon.

&gt; I don't believe our extension will have the authority to change macos user defaults. Can you cross-post this issue to VSCode?

Following on from https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1975.

The aim of this issue is to either enable key repeat by default on MacOS, or to more proactively notify MacOS users that they can set this option. This is an issue in the VSCode vim plugin as by default users cannot hold h/j/k/l to navigate.

As I said in https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1975, even though this is well documented in the VSCode readme, not all users think to check the documentation, and instead assume this is a bug.

From the [README](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#mac-setup):

&gt; If key repeating isn't working for you, execute this in your Terminal. 
&gt;
&gt; defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false         # For VS Code
&gt; defaults write com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false # For VS Code Insider
&gt;
&gt; We also recommend going into System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard and cranking up the Key Repeat and Delay Until Repeat settings to improve your speed.

There are a few questions here:

 * Does this impact all MacOS users?
 * Can we programatically set this option on MacOS?
 * Would there be any downside to doing so?
 * If not, can we more proactively notify impacted users that they can easily fix this issue.

If anyone can answer any of those questions, please comment in here.

    <Title>VS Code no longer respects remapped escape key using xmodmap</Title>

I use xmodmap to swap the meaning of the Esc and Caps Lock keys. In other words, I press the physical Esc key to enable caps lock (very rare) and the physical Caps Lock for escape (very common). This used to work fine in VS Code 1.8.1 but misbehaves in 1.14.2. VS Code is the only software I have used that does this.

Swapping Esc and Caps Lock is common among Vim users, who frequently use the Esc key. See e.g. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_XWindows.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Make a file swap_escape with the following content:
```
remove Lock = Caps_Lock  
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
```

2. Use xmodmap to remap the keys
```
xmodmap swap_escape
```

3. Caps Lock should now perform the function typically assigned to Esc, and vice versa.

4. Select some text in VS Code. Press the Caps Lock key. Expected: text is unselected (because the key means escape to the OS). Observed: nothing happens.

5. Select some text in VS Code. Press the Esc key. Expected: selection remains, caps lock is enabled in the OS. Observed: Text is unselected _and_ caps lock is enabled in the OS.

    <Title>Finish editing of CLI specified file should end --wait</Title>
    <Description>testing #30717:

I would expect that the "--wait" ends when the file specified as a CLI argument is closed in the editor. The current model of when "--wait" ends appears to me less intuitive.

In the following cases "--wait" did not end (but I was expecting that it would end):
- launch "code --wait foo.txt" and open a second file "abc.txt" in the same window. Close the editor with "foo.txt". Now I would expect the "--wait" to end but VS Code to stay open.
- launch "code --wait foo.txt" and load a folder in the same window. Now foo.txt is definitively not open any more but  "--wait" does not return.

    <Title>Support "window.titleBarStyle": "custom-inset" setting</Title>
    <Description>Electron supports another titlebar style called `hiddenInset` ([more about it)](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/frameless-window.md#hiddeninset).

We currently use the `hidden` style when setting `"window.titleBarStyle": "custom"`, therefor I think we should map `"window.titleBarStyle": "custom-inset"` to `hiddenInset`.

The only use case I can think for this is that it enables to hack the interface into those mockups seen in #12377 (notice the semaphore perfectly lined up with the tabs) without needing to patch vsc itself, just with some CSS using [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css).

It should be trivial enough to implement, if you want I can help with that.</Description>

    <Title>Feature request: Show file paths in inactive panes</Title>
    <Description>It'd be great to have a way to show file paths in inactive editor panes. I have tabs turned off, so a lot of empty screen space is wasted in inactive tabs that aren't showing paths.

In the below screenshot the active pane showing the file's path is the on the right. My proposal is to introduce a setting to enable showing file paths in all panes regardless of focus.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launched NVDA on Windows (10) yesterday afternoon
2. Ever since that moment, the screen reader notification is permanently on the bottom bar, even after quitting the screen reader and restarting my PC several times
3. In addition, my issues with lines not wrapping and the mini-map disappearing (which I only just noticed) seem to be related to this.

    <Title>Focus next search result (kb: F4) position in the result set is reset whenever the selected contents of the active editor are modified</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063
- Extensions: the listing length exceeds browsers' URL characters limit
---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Find in Files and do a search that will bring up multiple results, for example, search for 'document'
2. Press F4 (focus next search result) a couple of times
3. Suppose that you are focused on the 4th file from the result, replace the selection 'document' with 'activeDocument' (it also matches the original search term) or with 'window' (it doesn't match the original search term); both will trigger this issue
4. Press F4 - the focus is now in the first file of the result set

I suspect this is somehow the expected behavior, considering that the files in the result set are being watched and the search is rerun automatically, but if you change some other text in the active editor that is not selected by the 'focus next search result', the focus will jump to the 5th result in the example from the steps above.

If this is the default behavior, would it be possible to add a setting for this so that whenever I press F4, the focus will always jump forward?

    <Title>Add ability to exclude files using files.exclude ignoring case</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.10 Insider
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a folder, for example: someCamelCaseTestFolder;
2. Add files.exlude rule: "somecamelcasetestfolder": true;

Actual result: Folder is still visible in the VS Code Explorer.
Expected result: Folder should be hidden, ignoring the case (like in .gitignore for example).

As far as in Windows there is no ability to create two different folders "AAA" and "aaa" in the same parent folder I don't see any reason to make exclude pattern case sensitive.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.9 stable release

Ability to set default file encoding on a per-language basis.

I have files for older programming languages that I need to open with Codepage 852 or 437 but I can't set the default file encoding on a per language basis.  These files are not in self-contained repositories so setting a workspace-wide setting doesn't work, and for the most part everything else is UTF. I'd like to be able to add a setting in the language configuration to open a file with specific encoding by default and override the workspace   ##default.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a file with more than 999 examples of a text string (e.g. 2,000 lines containing "This is a line").
2. Highlight a word or phrase, and to highlight all matches, press ctrl+shift+l (or whatever editor.action.selectHighlights has been mapped to).

Only the first 999 matches will be selected. This is a problem when working with large files.

    <Title>Window gets off screen when switching monitors</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1 (But occurred in earlier versions)
- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with the laptop like Surface 3 Pro, and connect a large size monitor. Keep the laptop screen as the Main Screen
2. Launch VS Code. Use the VS Code on the second monitor
3. Use it for a bit, then close it cleanly by exiting the app.
4. Make the attached monitor as "Make this my main display" from the Display settings (right click on the desktop).
5. Launch VS Code again.

You will sometimes see that the new window VS code generates is completely off screen.

Expected Behavior:

Make sure that the new  window will not go off-screen, but at least the top of the window to be visible on the visible area on either of the monitors so that I can click it and move it to the place I would like. 

Workaround:

Make the laptop screen the main screen, then re-launch the VS Code, or temporarily disconnect the other monitor.

Happy that I can now move the debug toolbar in the the 1.3 update! However, I think it is better suited for the sidebar, as it is often/constantly in the way.

Alternately, it could be attached to the debug console.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an existing VSCode window open
2. Run `code -w -r file.js`
3. Only the `-w` flag gets honored, but not `-r`. (So file opens in a separate window)

In that circumstance `-w` should probably wait for the _editor_ to be closed (and not the window, since that's reused)

- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063

It would be quite helpful to (optionally) limit the search to the open files only, even when a project/folder is open.

For example, I am working on some feature, adding TODOs here and there, and all files that I edited are naturally open. I'd like to search for all TODOs, but not in the entire project (there are thousands of TODOs in the big project), I'd like to limit the searches only to the currently opened files.

Currently, the UI in the Search tab provides a couple of buttons in "files to ignore" field ("Use Ignore Files" and "Use exclude settings").

I'd like to see a button in the "files to include" field, with similar styles as the two buttons above and named "Use Opened Files" or something like that.

Naturally, both ways should be possible, searching the entire project and searching only in the open files.</Description>

Basically, I can't use the Zen Mode on my wide screen 32-inch monitor, since all the code is on the very left side of the screen, while I (and I assume any other sane person working on computer) am usually positioned at the center of the screen, not on the far left.

It would be great if Zen Mode could support some kind of "centered" view, wen the text/code is centered in the middle, not on the very left.

**w100p** and **h100p** (and everything with "p" at the end) don't want to appear in the snippets list.
So, we cannot use "Enter" to expand it.
We can only force it to expand, using Tab.
Not good.

    <Description>It's currently possible to execute something like `code ~/path1 ~/path2` and two different windows will be opened.

With the advent of multi-root I find it appropriate to have a `--workspace` option that will cause those paths to be opened in a single window.

This option would also be useful for extensions:
- [Projects+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-projects-plus): it might be interesting to have the option to open all the projects under a group in a new workspace, without messing around with `Add Folder to Workspace...` commands and `.code-workspace` files.</Description>

If we have a feature to sync all extensions between both systems. That will be very good. 

Something like Visual Studio theme sync. 

And give the option to install button in the Web site to push extensions to all systems, the user logged in. (Like Android/WP store)

    <Title>".vscode/settings.json" inside a workspace folder will render the editor inoperable</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.16.0-insider  b9ac10234f86f145fdbcf066758934e0857d7592, 2017-08-25T05:24:57.523Z 
- OS Version: Windows 10
- Reproduces without extensions: Yes (note: extensions' .vscode/*.json doesn't seem to be affected)

Steps to reproduce:
- Place (an empty is enough) .vscode/settings.json file under a workspace folder,
- Open the workspace,
- Every file will now display "Place your folder settings here to overwrite those from the Workspace Settings." and merge some of the parsed .json contents with the editor, thus rendering the editor pretty much inoperable as it breaks e.g. syntax hilighting.

In my case, the .vscode/settings.json was a leftover file from an older version. Don't think it should break the VSCode anyway? A day older or so build was working just fine, so this is likely due to some very recent change. Tried with and without extensions.</Description>

    <Title>allow unix sockets to be created outside the --user-data-dir folder</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: all
- OS Version: GNU/Linux docker containers

this is a follow up of #28126. 

The core issue at play here is understanding that containers are not persistent. So, if I run vscode inside a docker container and user configurations are to be persistent, I need to mount the `--user-data-dir` folder into an user disk like `D:\`. This is fine in mac and linux, but not in windows using docker for windows. Example: 

```sh
$ docker run -i -t -v /d/vscode/config:/root/.vscode ninrod/vscode:latest bash
```

Sadly, I cannot do this because `/d/vscode/config` is a NTFS filesystem structure which does not understand unix sockets so `vscode` crashes on startup. 

Please, allow the user to tell vscode to create these sockets that are created on `--user-data-dir` elsewhere. Example: `/var/run/vscode` or something:

```sh
.vscode $ w
 ~/.vscode at root@container using -zsh $
.vscode $ l *.sock
srwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Aug 24 14:16 1.14.2-main.sock
srwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Aug 24 14:16 1.14.2-shared.sock
.vscode $
```

    <Title>Objects that can trigger commands can't pass arguments to them</Title>
    <Description>There are many objects that are able to trigger commands, like [StatusBarItem](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#StatusBarItem), but not all of them (probably none of them) support a complementary `arguments` field defining the arguments that will be passed to that command's handler.

The point is that it's not even impossible to make `StatusBarItem`s pass arbitrary arguments to arbitrary commands, but it requires some [tinkering](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-commands/blob/master/src/utils.ts#L89).

    <Title>Extension Dev: Opening files without triggering an onDidOpen event for other extensions</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;
In reference to this thread: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15723

I'd like to implement a "Scan all" command in my extension, that scans all of the relevant files in the workspace.  The easiest way to do this is to call workspace.OpenTextDocument, but doing so triggers an onDidOpen event that a lot of extensions listen for.  The result is that the "Problems" window doesn't just get the output of the analysis my own extension produces, but the output for every extension that generates problems and listens to the onDidOpen event.  Ideally I wouldn't inundate my users with output for other extensions when running a command for my own extension.  

I don't need the onDidOpen event myself (I can just do a client.sendRequest in the "then" of openTextDocument to trigger my own analysis).  Is there any chance @dbaeumer that you changed your stance from the previous thread and there is now some mechanism to open a file without triggered an onDidOpen? I would argue that there is a difference between the user opening a file in the UI, and an extension opening a file that is never displayed in the UI.  In the latter case, probably doesn't make sense for anyone but that extension to know it opened (i.e. be able to suppress sending onDidOpen to any other extensions).

thanks

    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T17:15:57.756Z)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open new Code window
2. Create one new document and add any content to it, without saving
3. Create another new document and also add any content to it
4. Middle-mouse-click either document. A modal dialog appears asking if you want to close without saving. Do not dismiss it.
5. Middle-mouse-click the other document while the modal dialog is visible.
6. Dismiss the modal dialog using "Don't save" or "Cancel" (save probably works too, but I haven't tried it).

Expected behavior: while the modal dialog is active, events to the blocked window are discarded. When the modal dialog is dismissed, the second document to be middle-clicked is still alive and well.

Actual result: immediately after the modal dialog is dismissed, another one appears asking what to do with the second document that was middle-clicked, confirming that events are queued instead of discarded. This seems to work with an arbitrary number of documents. I have not tested other interactions (like double-clicking the tab bar to create a new document).

Other UI elements, like the file panel of the left bar, are blocked.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Upgrade your PC to the latest available Windows 10 Insider Fast Ring build (16257)
2. The new OneDrive client has the option to let you see like if they're local also files that are on the cloud.
3. Try to maintain a local copy of a text file or a folder from OneDrive but right clicking on it and choosing "Always keep on this device"
4. Right click on it and choose "Edit with Code"
5. Notice that an empty file is opened
6. Manually open Code and try to open the same file from File -&gt; Open file.
7. You'll see an error claiming that the file doesn't exist.

If you try to do the same with any other editor (like notepad) the file is properly opened.</Description>

    <Title>API to create custom Activity Bar items and Panels with Extensions</Title>
    <Description>I have been unable to find any information on whether or not vs code has any plans to support the functionality to allow extensions to create new activity bar items and/or side bar panels. 

Would be useful for creating many types of extensions (team chat, project/time management, sql explorers, cli tool integration (docker, npm, composer, webpack, vagrant, etc...), even less obvious things like music players and documentation). I'm aware that a lot of these extensions exist, but they aren't easily accessible (open command palette, search for extension, select option, enter command...). 

This type of functionality would potentially allow myself and many other developers to work in vs code without ever having to open another tool or leave the editor. 

If this is something that would be considered, I would be willing to work on it. Thanks! </Description>

Steps to Reproduce:
In a JS project using webpack for example
1. Search for a String
2.If the result as a "one line" file to show, the search tab freezes during several seconds.
3. Scroll so the file disappear "Search" behaving correctly
4. Scroll back until the file appears again, it freezes

File example :  0.chunk.js.map

From my point of view seems like it's creating a tooltip with the whole file inside.

A compound configuration may reference multiple launch configurations.
When such a compound configuration is selected for launch, (debug toolbar, DEBUG list) and the debugging session is started (F5) the selected configuration is changed to the last referenced launch configuration.

Subsequently, to restart the compound configuration one must first manually select the compound configuration in the DEBUG dropdown list.

The expected behavior is to retain the selected compound configuration after debugging is terminated.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a node launch configuration - "Launch Program"
2. Create a chrome launch configuration - "Launch Chrome"
3. Create a compound configuration consisting of the above - "Launch &amp; Debug"
4. Select the compound - "Launch &amp; Debug"
5. Start debugging - F5
6. Stop debugging - Shift-F5, Shift-F5

The selected configuration is now "Launch Program"
The expected behavior is for the selected configuration to be "Launch &amp; Debug"

launch.json:
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",

    {

    <Title>no new line when pressing CTRL+C in terminal</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.14.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  open integrated terminal
2.  run long running operation
3.  press ctrl + c
4.  `Terminate batch job (Y/N)?` Shows up
5.  press ctrl + c again

Expected to jump to a new cleared line, but actually just a ^C shows up:

`Terminate batch job (Y/N)? ^C`

Another variation of this issue is to just:
1.  open integrated terminal
2.  either enter some text or not.
3.  press ctrl + c

In a normal cmd this would jump to a new cleared line, but actually nothing happens

This happens only in windows and not in mac.

This is caused by the output window's default coding is not utf-8 but ascii. 

Please also refer to this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44724461/task-output-encoding-in-vscode

Sublime Text3 and Atom don't have this issue on Mac.

I changed python cmd as below for a workround:
 "python": "export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 &amp;&amp; cd $dir &amp;&amp; python $fileName",

it gets REALLY annoying having to move it back and forth, because it just loves to sit on top of the one tab that I am actively using, then I go to launch my attach to chrome task, and then it gets in the way of that, since I just moved it out of the way of my tabs! </Description>

    <Title>Go to File doesn't find my JS files</Title>
    <Description>**UPDATE:** this might be related to JavaScript files and my `files.exclude` settings, see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32638#issuecomment-322768797.

I've got a folder open which has many sub-folders, many of them containing `gulpfile.js`. However, when I do Ctrl+P (Go to File), they are not listed.

In the screenshot, I've executed a search alongside Ctrl+P to demonstrate this:

This is the first time I see this issue, Ctrl+P has always been working reliably. I've tried restarting VSCode to no avail.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Not sure wha happened. I had just fetched and pulled from our Git repo (using Tower), and when I switched back to Code I saw this:

&lt;img width="1218" alt="screen shot 2017-08-16 at 8 46 50 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/835148/29363903-adca0a4e-825f-11e7-8e70-59b181ce2da8.png"&gt;

Clicking "developer tools", I see this:

I reloaded the window and now it seems fine.  Never saw that before.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add @return (boolean) keyword to a method documentation
2. @return boolean does not produce this error

It takes return (boolean) as valid code keywords and the rest of the code after that is highlighted like comments or text.

If @return is replaced with @retur or something not @return, the documentation highlight works just 
fine.

In my case the methods are static.</Description>

The way I originally triggered this was doing a diff of some encoded binary data.  This was a tiny piece of a 1000 character string.  Originally I thought it was a long line problem, but evidently not.

    <Description>_From @jacobrillema on August 15, 2017 15:35_

Latest insiders build 1.16.0-insider date of 8/15 is crashing. I could not find the offending extension right away but found this extension was causing the issue. Not sure how much this is helpful from the developer tools. Maybe something with the util.js file?

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Select a compound debugger (in my case C# and Chrome)
2. Hit F5
3. Drop down changes to the first debugger in the compound list.
4. Next run uses that instead of the compound debugger.

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.15.0
- OS Version: Linux Mint 18.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open "very big" dataset (mine have 50625 lines, and sorry, can't distribute)
2. Perform a search on this very big dataset.

The find window will show "1 of 999+" instead of highlighting every match. The minimap also show only a few results, although there's at least one match every single line.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5909442/29290708-7cd41630-8117-11e7-948e-5bcac3c71903.png)

Reproduces without extensions: Yes

Observations:
If I click to navigate to the previous match, it will show `? of 999+` but it work perfectly, setting the cursor on the correct position on the last line of the "very big" file, but still don't highligthing the match.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new file and set the language mode to "JavaScript React"
2. Add the following code:
```
const button = ({
  className
}) =&gt; (
  &lt;div className={className}&gt;
    Click me!
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
```
3. Add a default value for `className` in the destructured object parameter:
```
const button = ({
  className = 'button'
}) =&gt; (
  &lt;div className={className}&gt;
    Click me!
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
```
4. After this change, observe that JSX syntax highlighting is broken.

I took on the challenge to install vscode on void linux from source. The installation doesn't list all dependencies I needed. These were pkg-config, libXScrnSaver, gconfmm. Now its working, with the only exception being the integrated terminal. Would be neat if you could update the installation notes.

First I type (F) and the snippet opens without problem.
But if I too lazy to type (F) and type just (F - opening of snippet will not absorb the second parenthesis.
I think it should.

My snippet in "javascript.json" file:

```
"(function() {...})()": {
  "prefix": "()()",
  "body": [
    "(function() {",
    "\t",
    "})()"
  ],
  "description": "(function() {...})()"
}
```

So, the prefix is just made of symbols - ()()
It will show snippet for "f()()", and it will show snippet for "()()f", but not just ()()
Has it been made like this for a reason, or is it a bug?</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. OneDrive installed on Windows 10, VSC latest version installed. I have Onedrive installed on other PC's and MAC syncing the same folders. [Note: same issue experience with Dropbox and Google Backup&amp;Sync clients]
2.Open file in onedrive e.g. *.ino or *.cpp and edit it
3. Save file - on what seems to be random occasions I get the following error from VSC.
4. **Note: I have reproduced problem using both Google Backup&amp;Sync cliend and DropBox.**
5. **Note: This error does not occur on my MAC version of VSC, only Windows 10**

    <Description>Currently, Color Picker can only output colors in uppercase 6-digit format. This may be in conflict with linting rules for a project.
I think this should be configurable through settings:
- uppercase/lowercase;

- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601
- Reproduces without extensions: Yes

## Steps to Reproduce:

I made a `task.json` in my project's workspace. Apparently there is a problem with the way command arguments are being parsed.

1. make the following `task.json` in `.vscode` directory in the workspace.

```js
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "myTask",
            "command": "grep \"HELLO\" \"${file}\"",
            "type": "shell",
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
2. Since this is the default task now, hit `CTRL+SHIFT+B`

## Output
```
&gt; Executing task: grep "HELLO" "c:\Users\rteshnizi\project\.vscode\tasks.json" &lt;

Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
Try 'grep --help' for more information.

Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.
```
## Expected Behavior
Output from Git Bash in vscode terminal
```
            "command": "grep \"HELLO\" \"${file}\"",
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .vscode/settings.json.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
```
Output from cmd in vscode terminal
```
            "command": "grep \"HELLO\" \"${file}\"",

    <Title>Add JS object completion / Intellisense for prototype accessors</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.15.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

When creating a JS object and defining some accessors, I found that I couldn't get the intellisense after `this.`

Example code :

```js
function Obj(foo) {
    this.foo = foo;
}

Obj.prototype = {
    get bar() {
        return this.// No intellisense here
    },
    set bar(val) {
        this.foo = val
    }
};
```
But creating a method with `Obj.prototype.test = function () {...}` will get me the intellisense.

Also after [asking on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45634999/is-it-possible-to-enable-js-object-intellisense-in-prototype-accessors-in-visual) if it was possible to enable it by tweaking the user settings, someone pointed out that Visual Studio 2015 would give the intellisense.

Would it be possible to replicate the same lexical analysis for this case ?</Description>

Should be fixed.

I have created some snippets for JavaScript, I am a beginner, and I have followed the guide in the documentation for creating snippets. These are the snippets: 
`	"Case": {
		"prefix": "case",
		"body": [
			"case ${1:expression}:",
			"\t$2",
			"\tbreak;",
			"$0"
		],
		"description": "A case statement"
	},
    "Switch Statement": {
		"prefix": "switch",
		"body": [
			"switch(${1:expression}) {",
			"\tcase ${3:expression}:",
			"\t\t$4",
			"\t\tbreak;",
			"\t$5",
			"default:",
			"\t$2",
			"}$0"
		],
		"description": "A switch statement"
	},
     "Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": "console.log(\"$1\");$0",
		"description": "Log input to console"
	}
`

Steps to reproduce:
1. Use the new switch snippet.
2. Create a new case statement with the new snippet.
3. Use the log snippet inside the new case statement.
4. When writing inside console.log() parentheses, it also writes in the new line created by the case snippet.

Expected behaviour: edit only inside the parentheses.

    <Title>Feature request: show the last part of the working directory in terminal title</Title>
    <Description>A new feature was just added that shows the current process name inside the terminal name, like `node` instead of simply `cmd.exe`.

While it's a good thing, I think it could be improved even more by adding the current terminal working directory, or at least the *last part* of the working directory.

Right now, if you start two webpack watches, in a two different directories `c:\dev\project1` &amp; `c:\dev\project2`, you will end up with this:

```
1: node
2: node
```

If there was a way to get the last part of the current working directory, it could look like:

```
1: node &lt;projet1&gt;
2: node &lt;project2&gt;
```

Which I find a lot better. This may not be that easy to do on Windows though.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run `nodemon your-file.js`
2. node app will be running (on a port such as 3000)
3.  click on terminal and press `CTRL+C`
4. Visual Code takes too long to cancel nodemon execution
5. There is no UI info showing if terminal (bash.exe) is processing this cancel request
6. The prompt will be shown after a big delay `youruser@YourPC MINGW64 ~/YourFolder/your-node-rest-api (master)`

    <Title>Highlighting for PHP breaks when using a namespaced trait</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:22:50.650Z)
- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.6.0
- Extensions: N/A

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open/Create PHP file with content as follows:

```php
&lt;?php

class ExampleClass {
     // Referencing a trait without namespace works as expected:
    use ExampleTrait;
    $foo = "SUCCESS: This line will highlight properly.";

    // Referencing a trait with a namespace will break highlighting:
    use ExampleNamespace\ExampleTrait;
    $bar = "ERROR: This line will NOT highlight properly.";

    /* Highlighting remains broken across multiple lines,
        and will color ignore things like keywords, comments or quotation marks.
        However, highlighting appears to reset the moment it scans a closing brace, as such: }

        Note that while highlighting has been reset, this line is still broken because VS code did not register the start of this comment block. */

    $baz = "SUCCESS: This line, and subsequent lines, will highlight properly again.";
}

```
2. Compare VS Code highlighting to Markdown highlighting as presented above. After referencing a namespaced trait, syntax highlighting remains broken until the first brace, even if additional content is inserted before or after the $bar.

The issue might be caused by highlighting rules set up for the "use" keyword for importing/aliases or the "use" keyword for delegates, which are two different syntaxes.

    <Title>Mac: click-through from other app should focus on the editor area that was clicked</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:22:50.650Z)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Terminal area
2. In Code, click the code area to focus it
3. Switch to another app
4. Click terminal area in Code through another app

The expected behavior for click-through on macOS is that focus goes to the area that you've clicked. For instance, if I have a (standard) Terminal window with two tabs open and the Finder is the foreground program, clicking on a tab on that terminal window will both bring the Terminal app in focus and switch to the tab that I've clicked.

With Code, the actual behavior is that the program goes to the foreground but the focus within the app stays with whatever was focused at the time Code was put to the background.

This frequently causes me to start typing commands in my editor view.

    <Title>Remove or support toggle off option for this multiple versions of same file rubbish</Title>
    <Description>Feature request.

This feature you have added (I'm not sure when, I've come back to using VSCode after several months off) where it is now possible to have two versions of the same file in the editor (one is the same name but all lower case) is the worst design decision I have ever encountered for a source code editor app. It is a disaster. It causes me constant doubt, confusion and frustration, even losing code changes on occasion. 

It will likely mean the end of me using VSCode. It's a game breaker for me.
Unless I can turn it off.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add HTML
   ```html
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 1&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 2&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   ```

2. Comment a line
   ```html
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 1&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Line 2&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   ```

3. Toggle the comment. Notice that toggled line is not properly aligned (there is an unwanted space before the opening `&lt;p&gt;` tag and after the closing `&lt;/p&gt;` tag).

   ```html
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 1&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Line 2&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
   ```

   To further demonstrate the issue, repeatedly toggle the line comment on/off. Below is the result of toggling the same line on/off ten times.

   ```html
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 1&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Line 2&lt;/p&gt;          --&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   ```

   Multi-line comments are also affected. Below is the result of toggling the entire block of HTML on/off ten times:

   ```html
            &lt;!-- &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 1&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Line 2&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;          --&gt;   ```

I believe the expected behavior is for a toggled comment to restore the line's original alignment much like other toggled comments do. It appears that the issue is caused by space characters that are added when commenting (`&lt;!--[SPACE]` and `[SPACE]--&gt;`) which are not removed when uncommenting (only `&lt;!--` and `--&gt;` are removed).

    <Title>files.include setting OR a [^] "not" character class in files.exclude setting</Title>
    <Description>My use case is that VS Code is great for markdown. I want to be able to open a root folder and *only* show markdown or image files, but ignore everything else. 

Currently, with project settings, you can exclude certain files, but I essentially want the opposite: a setting that will only show files that matter for editing w/in VS Code (in this case, the markdown files). 

As an example, imagine wanting to document your 'My Documents' folders, or your Dropbox folder, etc. with markdown, but not actually wanting to open all files at the root of 'My Documents' in the context of VS Code. You just want to see the overlayed markdown  as use it as a "local wiki", which may or may not contain links to those files. </Description>

    <Title>Integrated Terminal Processes Not Stopped on VSCode Close or Reload</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.14.2
- OS Version: Windows 10 Ent

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Using Vue.js CLI, create a new project
2. Open project with VSCode
3. Open integrated terminal
4. execute command:  npm run dev  (this will start up the auto reload feature of the Vue.js CLI and will launch the browser.)
5. Use the extensions tab and reload an extension or close VSCode.

Easy to follow steps for creating project and launching are here:  [https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)

**Expected**:  VSCode would gracefully terminate the process running in the integrated command terminal. 

**Actual:** VSCode closes, but leaves the process started by the now closed integrated terminal running.  The only way to terminate the process is to use task manager.  This issue is very difficult to figure out the first time it happens.  In my case, I reloaded VSCode after starting up a terminal process.  When VSCode reopened, I tried re-running:  npm run dev.  I got a bizarre error about having the wrong version of Node.js installed on my machine.  An hour later I figured out what happened, but it was painful.

Please add a feature for VSCode to gracefully terminate any integrated terminal processes before it closes or reloads.

Thank you!!

    <Title>JSDoc wrapping long strings not working. Possible to concatenate or have a special format for it to concatenate</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

Steps to Reproduce:

```
/**
 * GrafConfig is the configuration class that is to be injected into the Graf class
 *      it does not do anything special!
 * 
 * @class GrafConfig
 * @param {Point []} points the (x,y) array of positions for the current graph
 * @param {string} xDescription the title for the x axis to be displayed
 * @param {string} yDescription the title for the y axis to be displayed
 * @param {string} title the title for the graph that will be displayed at the top
 * @param { }
 */
let GrafConfig = function (points, xDescription, yDescription, title) {}

/* this line here you can press ctrl+. after new GrafConfig */
var grafConf = new GrafConfig(graphBucket, "Years old", "daily Income", "age vs income chart");
```

1. you can copy my code from above to start, simply use the function and on the definition press ctrl+. two times to get the JSDoc information

](url)

my question is, if you get a really really long description can we get the wrapping to work nicer? currently it will just break it off in the middle rather then expanding out and wrap in horrible places. if you view my image where the red line is, it should concat

I think I've seen similar issues open but I haven't seen this exact problem open yet.

- Change the theme
- See that the font changes to Times New Roman or something
- Changing the theme again doesn't fix it but reopening the extension readme does.

    <Title>Terminal hides real exit code</Title>
    <Description>Steps:

- create a terminal using the internal API (e.g. like tasks does)
- register an onExit listener on the terminal instance
- execute a command in a terminal that returns an exit code !== 0 using the -c or /C option to exit the shell after the command has complete

Observe: the exit code passed to the listener is always 0. The underlying reason is that the exit code is the one of the node process we start to start the real terminal. And the node process always returns zero.

    <Title>Navigation/Cursor Position with High Surrogate Pairs</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.14.2
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have a file with a high surrogate pair character in it
2. Keyboard navigate and notice that there are _two_ positions for the cursor before the cursor moves, which affects copying and other positional items, including the `Col` number in the IDE

For example, this text will exhibit the problem:

```
|✔️|
```

Which contains the codepoint `U+2714`.

    <Title>Git clone dialog: right arrow doesn't deselect text</Title>
    <Description>- "Git: Clone" command
- Enter some git url, press enter
- Another quickopen is opened with the text prepopulated with my home dir. The text is selected.
- Press right arrow key
- Nothing happens
- I expect it to deselect text and put the cursor on the right

- If I press the left arrow key, it deselects and puts the cursor on the left

I'm guessing this is related to the feature in quickopen where it opens the selected file in the background when you press the right arrow key. But that isn't relevant here, so it seems like it should be disabled, since it makes it hard to add a subfolder to that text. Also reproes in command palette.</Description>

    <Title>Cannot read error message because error popup too small.</Title>
    <Description>When building code that might fail for any number of reasons I am commonly unable to even read the error message that pops up because the window only shows part of the first line. The error does not appears in the Problems, Output or Debug panes.

Here I am attempting to execute a Typescript project.

Here's how I created the project:

Create a directory and open VSCode there.

Press F1, enter "Debug: Open launch.json" and when prompted select environment node.js. This will generate a launch.json file configured for node.js.

Press CTRL+' to open the command prompt. Enter "tsc --init" this will generate a tsconfig.json file.
NOTE: tsc must be version 1.6 or greater. Check with "tsc -v", upgrade with "npm install -g typescript".

In tsconfig.json uncomment "sourcemap": "true"
In tsconfig.json uncomment "outdir" and set to "./output".

Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build, select nodejs build environment.

Press F5 to execute. Error message appears that cannot be read.

    <Title>Feature request: vscode extensions in json file</Title>
    <Description> # Feature request
## Feature
It would be nice to have a JSON file with all installed extensions and their versions, like package.json for node modules.

## Example
`extensions.json`
```json
 {
  "akamud.vscode-theme-onedark": "2.0.3",
  "ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar": "0.1.13",
  "...": "...",
}
```

## Use case
For those of us who switches often  between devices it would be easier to manage extensions.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install typescript:
`npm install typescript --save-dev`.

2. Create `tsconfig.json ` in the project's root directory:
```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "outDir": "./bld",
        "rootDir": "./",
        "strict": true,
        "alwaysStrict": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node"
    }
}
```
3. Create `tasks.json` in `./.vscode`:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "typescript",
            "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
            "presentation": {
                "echo": true,
                "reveal": "never",
                "focus": false,
                "panel": "shared"
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
4. Create `test.ts` in the project's root directory:
`console.log("Hello, world!");`

5. Open `test.ts` in VS Code editor tab. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B`. Despite isDefault is set to true and 'tsconfig.json' is explicitly specified in `tasks.json`, VS Code still asks to choose default build task: `tsc: build tsconfig.json recently used tasks`. When I press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in the context of other editor tabs, e. g. `tsconfig.json`,  confirmation is not required.

npm tasks work as expected, i. e. I get no additional confirmations if `isDefault: true`.

I spilled coffee on my keyboard and some of my keys aren't working. I remapped them to function keys. I changed `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us`  and added:

        key &lt;FK04&gt; {	[	  5,	percent		]	};

I logged out and logged in again and now F4 works as my 5 everywhere. I have tried it in gnome-terminal, vim, gvim, emacs, chrome etc. But VS Code doesn't respect it and opens the "search/replace" dialogue when I press it. 

I have tried it in vs code with all extensions disabled(`code --disable-extensions`) and it didn't work. 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Remap f4 to 5 as described above. Log out and log in again. f4 should be 5 everywhere.

2. Open vs code and press f4. It opens "search/replace".

    <Title>Error message no Build Task found, when there is a build task defined in the task.json</Title>
    <Description>I've added an attribute to the taskDefinition of the npm task provider:

```json
    "taskDefinitions": [
      {
        "type": "npm",
        "required": ["script"],
        "properties": {
          "script": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The npm script to customize"
          },
          "path": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The path to the folder of the package.json file that provides the script. Can be ommitted."
          }
        }
      }
    ]
```

Notice that the property `path` is not defined as a required property.

This is the code to create the task definition:

```typescript
	let kind: NpmTaskDefinition = {
		type: 'npm',
		script: script,
		path: rootPath
	};
```

In our [smoke test repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-smoketest-express.git) we have a setup with an existing task.json file with this contents, that defines a build task:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "npm",
            "script": "eslint",
            "problemMatcher": {
                "base": "$eslint-stylish",
                "fileLocation": "absolute"
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Running Tasks&gt;Run Build Task... results in:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/172399/28462595-27b62728-6e1c-11e7-810c-f5306c126919.png)

The error message should be more specific and tell that the build task was found but that the definition has issues. However, since the property  `path` is not required property, I would have expected that the task the existing build task still works. 

So there appear to be two issues:
- the non-required property in the task definition is not properly handled
- the error message is misleading.

    <Title>Editor rulers disappear at lower zoom levels</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.14.0-insider (6afdf303bb8f70d840c12a43c036e98a9da50d41, 2017-07-05T09:01:45.828Z)
- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.6.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Zoom out the text editor one step (Cm + -)
2. Toggle the side bar so that it is visible then slowly resize it. At certain positions, the ruler dissapears.

I'm _guessing_ that this is happening because scaling is handled using a cheap algorithm that's throwing away the one-pixel ruler at certain widths. In which case it might be handy to have an `editor.rulerWidth` property so that I can set the ruler to be 2 or 3 pixels wide, etc.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Start a program that uses bunyan for logging.
2. To make the bunyan output readable, pipe the output through bunyan-cli.
To do so, create a `pipe-bunyan.cmd` with the following content:
```
@ECHO OFF
node %* | bunyan -o short
```
3. Specify the script as a `runtimeExecutable`, like so:
```
"runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}\\.scripts\\pipe-bunyan.cmd",
```

Vscode already has `Go to Bracket`, but I can't go to any wrapping bracket when the cursor is in any line inside the wrapping brackets, it would be a helpful enhancement being able to do that (I'm used to this in Atom).

The menu "Los" is not understandable. Is it a fate, or a lot, or a batch, or does it mean "Let's go!" Go … where? Was that "Go" in English? That would be "gehen" in German. Probably just a stupid as in English. It might be helpful to use the translation for "Go to" which would be "Gehe zu". Some commands in that menu are actually called "Gehe zu (…)".

The second command in that menu is "Weiterleiten" which means forwarding something to somebody. An e-mail message for example, that can be forwarded. From the surrounding commands I guess that you did not mean "to forward" but "the direction forward" which is "vorwärts" in German. The opposite of "zurück" ("back").

Also, the hotkeys are highly inconsistent. Some are positioned at the right end of the menu popup, in grey colour, but completely in English. Others are appended to the command text, left-aligned, in black colour, and partially translated ("Ctrl" was translated to "STRG" (correct would be "Strg") and arrow key names are still in English). These have brackets around them. Why does it look like somebody threw a bomb in there?</Description>

    <Title>Problem matchers can't match correctlly if output line is longer than width of Integrated Terminal</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.14.0
- OS Version: Windows7 and 8.1
- Extensions: C/C++ 0.12.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Narrow down the width of Integrated Terminal.
2. Run build task with problem matchers.

VSCode 1.14.0 with tasks.json 2.0.0 executes tasks in Integrated Terminal and compiler's outputs are wrapped to match with terminal width. This causes issue on problem matchers.

Here is example.

There seems to be no editable foreground color properties for **editorGroupHeader** in the **workbench.colorCustomizations** option. What I want to do is to change the color of the icons on the top right corner of the editor.

    <Title>Using the Find Widget (CTRL+f) adds padding/margin/something above first line of code</Title>
    <Description>So I noticed that whilst using the Find widget (CTRL+f), padding/margin/something is added above the first line of code.
![Issue in action](http://i.imgur.com/I44S4jz.png)

It seems to be about the same height as the find widget's height. So I'm guessing it's responsible. Actually if you close the widget the spacing disappears along with it.

Honestly, I don't even know if this is a bug.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a file
2. Press CTRL+f
3. Scroll up (if you don't see a chasm above the first line of code), otherwise you should already be seeing it.

1. New Javascript React file

2. Seems to only try to do block commenting on jsx components like:

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;div className="App-header"&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Test App&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
```

3. Hit Cmd( or Ctrl)+/ to comment the whole code and it will put /* */ around it

4. Hit Cmd( or Ctrl)+/ and you expect it to uncomment, but it just puts line comments // on the selection

It seems that when you set decorations, the decoration isn't applied to newlines. In this case, the decoration is being applied across three lines, but as you can see, the newline is not decorated.

    <Title>Feature request: Ability to open the integrated terminal drawer from the right side of editor</Title>
    <Description>It would be fantastic if the drawer that the integrated terminal lives in could be opened from the right side of the editor window like a vertical split. 

I end up running into this situation from time to time:

![screen shot 2017-04-25 at 2 03 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2437424/25402943/1b64d88e-29c0-11e7-805e-2b27af483764.png)

I have ton of empty space on the right side of my editor, I'd like to have my editor and terminal open at the same time, and I have to scroll up and down in my editor to see everything or close the terminal. 

It's not a problem, def don't mind doing it, but it would be cool if I could change what side of the editor the drawer opens on. 

It would be _super great_ if that configuration could be bound to a hot key or updated from the command palette so that the direction could be changed on the fly. 

Thanks for considering the request!

    <Title>workspaceRoot invalid on Git Bash and WSL</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.11.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set default shell to Git Bash or WSL (CTRL+SHIFT+P - "shell")
2. Run a launch task using `${workspaceRoot}`

Here's an example launch config:

```json
{
  "name": "Debug All (node2)",
  "type": "node2",
  "request": "launch",
  "protocol": "inspector",
  "stopOnEntry": false,
  "args": [
    "--nolazy",
    "${workspaceRoot}/debugall.js"
  ],
  "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/",
  "preLaunchTask": null,
  "runtimeExecutable": null,
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development"
  },
  "sourceMaps": false,
  "outDir": null,
  "console": "integratedTerminal",
  "skipFiles": [
    "&lt;node_internals&gt;/**",
    "**/node_modules/**"
  ]
},
```

Running this with the Powershell terminal works just fine. When running in WSL or Git Bash, the `${workspaceRoot}` uses backslashes in the path and fails:

```sh
$ cd c:\dev\projectname/ ; env NODE_ENV=development node --inspect=32931
 --debug-brk --nolazy c:\dev\projectname/debugall.js
bash: cd: c:projectname/: No such file or directory

Note that these commands will work in Git Bash if the backslashes are converted to the proper forward-slashes:

```sh
$ cd c:\dev\projectname
bash: cd: c:devprojectname: No such file or directory
$ cd c:/dev/projectname
[no error]
$ node c:/dev/projectname/debugall.js
[runs without error]
```

Converting the slashes doesn't fix WSL, though. In Git Bash the drives are mounted like `/c/` for `c:\`. In WSL they're mounted at `/mnt/c/`, so it may require changing the drive part of `${workspaceRoot}` depending on the shell you have selected. We could hard-code the workspace root, but that forces everyone to use a *nix based shell and have the project in the same path on their different machines.</Description>

Currently the task framework can only trigger external commands (programs or shell scripts). Since Ctrl+Shift+B is taken by the task framework we should allow extension to participate in 'build' and 'test' (and any other composite task) by executing a command in the extension itself.

The command should be launched using `bash -c` or `cmd /c` (I think), which will run it under a consistent shell and exit upon completion. You can also now tell the terminal to wait on exit using the `waitOnExit` arg on `TerminalInstance`.

1. Hitting &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;\\&lt;/kbd&gt; does nothing.

It should select the braces and everything in between them. I use this in vim (with `v%`) all the time to copy/paste code blocks.</Description>

The feature is expand to brackets.

Windows / Linux: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;m&lt;/kbd&gt;

Today an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=guosong.bracketselection) exists with this functionality. I believe we should bring this feature into the product.

Hover over the margin in the settings, notice we use a weird color to decorate the settings line.
In light theme it is banana yellow and in dark it is gray.
I do not think we use these colors in other places. Could we instead use a well known color?

Maybe the debug top stack frame decoration color?

The issue seems to be to do with the .desktop file distributed with 'code' requesting that 'code' be launched with file URIs which it can't handle. It should have an Exec argument of %F not %U

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a folder on an LXDE Ubuntu Desktop
2. Use right-click menu to choose 'Open With' Visual Studio Code
3. Code editing window opens showing no code at all, even when file contains 1k of code
4. Turns out that it has opened a file called like /home/user/file:/home/user/folder/source.py since its .desktop file incorrectly requests a file:// URI which it can't handle

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;

I edited the /usr/share/applications/code.desktop to add the --disable-extensions flag, then shut down and relaunched from the finder. The same problem presents.

Reproduces without extensions: Yes 


# Workaround

I modified the /usr/share/applications/code.desktop file to fix the issue by changing the Exec line to read as follows...

```
Exec=/usr/share/code/code %F
``` 

...instead of the original which read...

```
Exec=/usr/share/code/code --unity-launch %U
```

After this, the issue went away.</Description>

![Fucked up control flow](https://i.imgur.com/D9lomEa.png "Fucked up control flow")

Typing  an if statement
causes code to look like this:

```javascript
if(true)
    {
// Why is there a tab?
    }
```

Note the tabs before the braces?


It should work like this
```javascript
if(true)
{
 // No tab before the braces!
}
```
I have no idea if this is an option or not, but if this is an option i'd recommend to remove it immidiately because that is just "jesus what the hell is that?". I have no idea what happened it started to act this weird after updating to the latest version.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create new file
2. Select "JavaScript" Language Mode
3. Enter the following into the file:

```javascript
var foo = {
    'anything quoted': '(anything starting with an left parenthesis or angle bracket'
};

// comment highlighted incorrectly "highlighted like a string literal (incorrect)"
var highlightedIncorrectly;
```

Reproduces without extensions: Yes

### Problem

Creating an object that has a value that is a single-quoted string that starts with a left parenthesis `(` or left angle bracket `&lt;`, causes all following code to highlight incorrectly.

I thought this was related to #30425, but 1.14.2 didn't fix it.

---

### Base case

Starting with the following base case that highlights all following code incorrectly:

```javascript
var foo = {
    'hello': '(world'
};
```

Certain changes will fix or not fix the subsequent syntax highlighting problem, as detailed here:

### Cases that will highlight correctly

```javascript
// double-quoting the object value
var foo = {
    'hello': "(world"
};

// un-quoting or double-quoting the object key
var foo = {
    hello: '(world'
};
// or
var foo = {
    "hello": '(world'
};

// not starting the value with the left parenthesis
var foo = {
    'hello': 'world('
};

// using a left curly bracket or left square bracket instead
var foo = {
    'hello': '{world'
};
// or
var foo = {
    'hello': '[world'
};
```

### Cases that will *not* highlight correctly

```javascript
// using a left angle bracket instead
var foo = {
    'hello': '&lt;world'
};

// closing the paren in the object value
var foo = {
    'hello': '(world)'
};

// adding properties to the object
var foo = {
    one: 1,
    'hello': '(world',
    "stuff": 'things'
};

// using an expression instead of an assignment statement
foo = {
    'hello': '(world'
};
// or
({
    'hello': '(world'
});

```

All of these register as valid code (no errors reported), but do not highlight the following code correctly.

---

For what it's worth, the use case that provoked this was a lookup map for brackets:

```javascript
var pairs = {
    ')': '(',
    '}': '{',
    ']': '['
};

    <Title>MRW: Cannot debug any folder except first</Title>
    <Description>testing https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30722, specifically "debugging (node.js and extension host debugging) work as before".

Insiders 1.15.0 9a308d11

I've created a workspace with all of my extensions and the idea is that I could do a lot of copy/paste between folders and then run/debug any of the individual extensions.  

However, it appears I can only debug the first folder of my multi-root workspace, there is no way for me to pick which one I wish to launch.

On backlog?

    <Title>Launch VSCODE Application in WSL without XServer</Title>
    <Description>I have installed windows 10 (b.1703) creators update recently and I am using ubuntu subsystem(WSL).There I have installed Visual Studio Code successfully(Node.js everything installed).

I followed this link too - [support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

Problem is that any GUI elements required application can be launch but not working(no GUI will be elements displayed reason may be WSL has no direct Graphic driver support).

![VSCOE Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3683121/28388703-38ee16e4-6cf1-11e7-95ae-15afa1362140.PNG)

As image shown above.after I command to execute vscode thorough 

&gt; macxfadz@BC-LPTP:~$ code

 the WSL BASH take few seconds and nothing display during that time and print second line with empty respond.

I wanted to know How to provide graphic driver support to WSL in order to facilitate GUI applications(in this case VSCODE)? without installing 3rd party software such as XMing-Xserver,putty etc.

Else do we have any other mechanism to achieve it ? only modifying Ubuntu(Linux subsystem) side? other than switching to Windows 10 Insider preview builds?

**Please note that** I don't want to launch VSCODE installed in windows 10 launch via WSL ubuntu bash.</Description>

    <Description>Refs: #30722

I am working on vscode all the time and now I started working on multi root with also vscode-docs. Everything is great except I get pestered by a lot of ux things which I have dismissed already in the past. These include:

1. Welcome page
2. Workspace recommendations
3. TS check

Probably many others.
I do not have a suggestion on how to improve this, but we should be aware that this can be frustrating. Maybe some transition strategy for the storage would be useful.</Description>

Language: Javascript:

When creating first code block "{" and pressing enter the auto fill and indent doesn't quite work as it used to, it creates the closing block and creates new lines, but does not indent them back to where they should be

a for loop looks like:
```
for(var key in object)
    {

    }
```

instead of:
```
for(var key in object)
{

}
```

the other way of doing it works fine when it looks like:
```
for(var key in object){

}
```

The same happens with if statements too, but it doesn't happen with switch statements
Steps to Reproduce:

1. create one side of code block "{" 
2. press enter to auto fill the rest</Description>

    <Title>File browser enhancement </Title>
    <Description>Hi guys,

There are few things I miss from [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree).

Most notably:

1. Ability within the file browser to search filenames and dirnames so I can easily jump / navigate within very large file structures
2. Add more commands like the one provided by [File utils](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sleistner.vscode-fileutils)

    <Title>Feature Request: Propose undefined method names as autocomplete suggestions</Title>
    <Description>Especially during UI coding, I repeatedly find myself in the following situation:

    ....
    &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick} /&gt;

and `this.handleClick` is undefined. Next, I place the cursor in the class, and type...

    private handleClick(e: MouseEvent) {
    }

It would be super useful if `handleClick` would be offered as auto-complete suggestion by VSCode in this situation. In general, any undefined symbol name could be offered as a completion option when typing a new method. There's a pretty good chance in general that the name of a method-under-construction already appears as an undefined symbol somewhere else in the class. I don't know how technically challenging this feature would be, but it sure would come in handy.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launch code.
2. Run build task.

At the time, there was a compiler error in my project, so the standard npm error stuff got output to the console, but I was unable to scroll up to see what tsc had output. Restarting vscode had no effect.

This is the error I get on the developer console when I click on the terminal window to give it focus:
```

    <Title>Expose document.hidden</Title>
    <Description>It would be helpful if VSC exposed `document.hidden` via an API, so that extensions could take advantage of it in order to skip some work.

Just to provide a concrete use case: I've made an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-github-notifications-bell) that calls a GitHub API endpoint every X seconds, the problem is that if I have N workspaces the extension will make N requests instead of 1, it would be better if it could avoid making requests for hidden workspaces.

    <Title>Autocomplete/Intellisense not working</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: `1.14.1`
- OS Version: `Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit`

VScode stops showing suggestions after a few seconds. When VScode just starts everything works but after a few seconds its stops showing suggestions.

For example, when importing a module VScode used to show the available methods in that module or it would show the available methods for a function when `ctrl + space` was pressed but now it doesn't. Now it just shows the variables that I have used in that file.

I only use VScode for `React, React-Native` so this behavior is seen in JS files don't know about others.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Maybe upgrade to latest version
2. Try to import some methods from a module or try to check available methods on a function

tried this `code --disable-extensions` to check but still getting that issue.

    <Title>WorkspaceEdit doesn't support creating new files</Title>
    <Description>Not sure if this is a bug or just a missing feature!

I'm using `WorkspaceEdit` in my Code Actions provider but noticed that when a code action requires a new file (eg. creating a file from an import statement) it crashes because it can't find the file to modify (for both `insert` and `replace`).

I can't see anything on the API for allowing creation of new files, nor an easy way to detect if a file exists. I could obviously us node's `fs` class for this, but it seems a little weird to start doing that separate from the nice `WorkspaceEdit` class.

Is it valid to have `WorkspaceEdit` support creation of new files were required or is creating the files "manually" the expected way? I had a quick look at some other extensions (like TypeScript) but it seems like they don't handle it either (presumably none of their code actions need to create new files yet?).</Description>

Problem:
VSCode consumes 600 MB of my home dir. In .config/Code/ User/, CachedData/ and Cache/ use about 200 MB each. Our home dirs are on a network drive and are limited by a quota. I have no say about it's size.

Some suggestions to mitigate this:

- In Linux caches should be stored in ~/.cache/ which I can symlink to local storage.
- Setting to change location of addons or large storage.
- Perhaps advertise how much space addons require

    <Title>Missing autocomplete for TypeScript</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.14.1 (1.14.1)
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.5 (16F2104)

When editing *.ts files, code autocomplete misses many hints like datatypes, const, let, etc.
 
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a TypeScript file, type some code.
2. like below:
&lt;img width="827" alt="2017-07-14 9 34 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3023607/28214284-362cdee0-68dc-11e7-866a-924b10bfb286.png"&gt;
There should be const instead of ctor(constructor)



&lt;img width="355" alt="2017-07-14 9 35 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3023607/28214308-54355548-68dc-11e7-9fc0-8fe2626630f2.png"&gt;
No hint for boolean, or number, or string.

In 1.13, everything is fine.


Plus, when I refer to developer tools, there are errors:

&gt; [Extension Host] Activating extension `vscode.typescript` failed:  [vscode.typescript]: Proposed API is only available when running out of dev or with the following command line switch: --enable-proposed-api vscode.typescript

This code worked with 1.13
```php
&lt;?php 
return array("Template", function ($id) { 
    ?&gt;
    &lt;div class="&lt;?php echo $id ?&gt;"&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php });
```

Minimal repro:

```php
&lt;?php 
return array(function () { 
    ?&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;?php 
});
```

Now with 1.14.1 it renders as mostly white:

testFunction();
```

To be sure I've removed old version and installed the new one - result was the same.

    <Title>Add Global Undo and Redo</Title>
    <Description>It would be nice if VS Code could support global undo and redo like in Visual Studio:

&gt;In addition to the typical undo and redo functionality that affects only individual files, the Visual Studio editor includes commands to undo or redo global actions that affect multiple files.

&gt;Global actions include renaming a class or namespace, performing a find-and-replace operation across a solution, refactoring a database, or any other action that changes multiple files.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee839600(v=vs.100).aspx

Right now it's difficult to undo a search and replace or refactoring because you have to go through every file.

    <Description>VSCode shows the find results squished into a narrow sidebar which makes them very hard to use if your window and sidebar isn't huge. You also can't have the find results and the file view at the same time, since the actions sidebar only lets you see one thing at a time.

Instead have a mode where the find results are a regular tab. Then you could tear it off, or toggle back and forth from code windows while the file view is still open and also have lots more room to see the find results. Also provide control over the number of context lines shown there.</Description>

wireless/ieee802154/mrf24j40/mrf24j40_regops.c:130:2: error: 'dev' undeclared (first use in this function)

The issue is that the path needs to be /nuttx/drivers/wireless/ieee802154/mrf24j40/mrf24j40_regops.c

As you can see, that means when the "Entering directory" line is printed, I need to somehow change the path mapping so that the path on the line with the error/warning is linked.

I realize I could fix it for this one case using the fileLocation setting, but that won't work if it's any of the other directories in the project.  Regex could solve it if there were some clever way of combining them.

I am hoping someone here has a clever solution in mind for this, or if maybe there is an easy-enough workaround.  I'd be awesome to be able to get the problem matcher working with this setup!</Description>

    <Title>Make update process faster on Windows</Title>
    <Description>I'm in a corp environment where we have a policy-driven on-demand virus scanner. This painfully slows down the update process of VS Code due to the scanning of every individual .js file.

I'm using a HP Z620 with SSDs... I can't imagine how slow it is for the average user with the same virus scanner.

Is there a way to 'bundle' the installation files together to increase speed during installation, or even maybe  update VS Code in the background and ask me for confirmation before the update-enabling relaunch?</Description>

    <Title>Debug Active Bar - usability feature-request</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

I like to use Debug Action Bar but it's somewhat inconvenient - it covers open tabs and I must move it around constantly (see image):
![vsc-old](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30110941/28110505-555e579a-66fb-11e7-99ac-e0e41e0695fb.jpg)

Suggestion:
Please, add a config file option "debug.actionBarPosition": "default" || "workbench".
"default" or not specified - classic behavior
"workbench" - debug controls are moved to workbench (see image):

For colored controls you can add third option if you like "workbenchColor" (see image):

**Steps to Reproduce:**

`div#app&gt;(div&gt;p#test*2)` correctly expands to:
````html
&lt;div id="app"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
````

while `div#app&gt;(div&gt;p#test*2)*2` incorrectly expands to:
````html
&lt;div id="app"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
````
it should expand to:
````html
&lt;div id="app"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
````

The same abbreviation expands correctly in Atom with the official Emmet plugin. (Tested just in case I was typing emmet jibberish!)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. create several custom custom snippets (Examples down)

```
"playerPos": {
		"prefix": "playerPos",
		"body": "local playerPos = player:getPosition()",
		"description": "playerPos"
	},
	"objectID 1": {
		"prefix": "playerID",
		"body": "local ${1:player}ID = ${1:player}:getId()",
		"description": "objectID"
	},
```
2. when snippets created and I write on new file: player
I get over 10 suggestions as to be expected.
So first time I write out the full word playerPos to get the snippet.

Next time when I start writing: player
First 3 suggestions should be last 3 used
Then next 3 suggestions for most used snippets (don't overlap)
Rest of suggestions param/func/snippets which used above lines
If suggestion bar not filled up by now then can continue as it is right now

(of course all suggestions should start or be similar with prefix)

    <Title>Command+Click on line in OUTPUT console should go to line in already open file</Title>
    <Description>_From @tylerb on July 10, 2017 18:34_

Repro:

1. Use two code views
2. Left view open an unrelated file
3. Right view open a test file with a failing test
4. Run test to generate output in the OUTPUT pane
5. Click on the left view to select it
6. command+click the failing line in OUTPUT

Expected result: the right view jumps to the line that was just command+clicked
Actual result: the file is opened, again, in the left view and then jumps to the line

I'd really like it if this process would first search to see if any view has the file open already.

Thanks!

    <Title>Feature request: 'New project' API</Title>
    <Description>I would like to suggest an API for extensions to hook into for starting new projects of a certain type.

My motivation is creating a user-friendly way of creating a new project, similar to an experience found in Big Brother Visual Studio, but better. [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools) provides a command `CMake: Quick Start` which creates a stub project with a single CMakeLists.txt file and a "Hello, World" level main.cpp. This is great way to skip some of the boilerplate associated by just getting a text editor with a compiler hooked up to it locally. (Something like godbolt, but locally, just to test something or get going on a new project.)

[Windows Template Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WASTeamAccount.WindowsTemplateStudio) is awesome and it were nice if a similar API could come integrated into VS Code where extensions could register their own quick start templates, or even more convoluted ones, as found in WTS.

If such a feature existed, I would gladly take the time and contribute to CMake Tools to create composable CMake script stubs. Something like:

I need a library that will:
- depend on clFFT and clBLAS
- have unit tests
- have docs created by doxygen

Plus I will need an executable:
- that links to the library
- which depends on Boost program options
- have docs created by doxygen

So something similar to WTS, but for CMake and baked into VS Code for seamless integration. Because this feature I believe is of general interest, it could be worth the effort to create an API for.

Ideas?

I encountered this when using the *default* Solarized Dark theme (not to be confused with the `Solarized-Dark` theme module, which works fine.) and mocha 3.0.2.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install mocha (my version is 3.0.2)
2. Write a simple test script, save as `test.js`, for example:

        describe("test", () =&gt; {
            it("test 1", () =&gt; { });
            it("test 2", () =&gt; { });
        });

3. Use the default "Solarized Dark" theme
4. Open the VSCode Terminal, type "mocha `test.js`"

The test names such as `test 1` and `test 2` are missing because the background color is the same as the text colors for them.

    <Title>[Feature Request] : Display multiple terminals using tabs, instead of drop down list</Title>
    <Description>Currently, when i want to switch between terminals in visual studio code, i need to change them via the drop down list near the top right corner. Is it possible to display terminals in tabbed format, so that developer can easily and quickly switch between them using tabs</Description>

    <Title>Emmet places HTML tags around the last word when entering text in between HTML tags.</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use Help &gt; Report Issues to prefill these. --&gt;
- VSCode Version: 1.31.1
- OS Version: Win 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have emmet/new emmet.
2.Type within html tags, then press tab.

&lt;!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. --&gt;
Reproduces without extensions: Yes

When trying to enter a tag quickly, say 

&gt; `&lt;h1&gt;words words words&lt;/h1&gt;`

 I expect the behavior to be like:

&gt; h1 -&gt; tab -&gt; enter contents of h1 tag -&gt; tab to end of tag to continue writing.

and you should get this. with the cursor at the end of the closing tag.

&gt; `&lt;h1&gt;words words words&lt;/h1&gt;|`



 

Instead I get something like this with the last word wrapped in a random tag, and the cursor and the end of the newly created tags.

&gt; `&lt;h1&gt;words words &lt;words&gt;&lt;/words&gt;|&lt;/h1&gt;.`

Yet if I hit space at the end of the word, so that there is nothing to put inside of tags, hitting tab goes to the end of the closing tag as I want it to.

The only plugin I have for the editor is "indent-rainbow" and my settings look like this:



&gt;     "editor.tabSize": 2,
&gt;     "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,
&gt;     "workbench.colorTheme": "Atom One Dark",
&gt;     "editor.rulers": [80,100],
&gt;     "editor.wordWrap": "off",
&gt;     "editor.cursorStyle": "line",
&gt;     "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
&gt;     "emmet.useNewEmmet": true
&gt; 

Here is a video showing my issue. https://streamable.com/ofkbv

I have also been able to reproduce this in Atom by installing the Emmet plugin, so it must have something to do with that, but I cannot find a setting to make it only put tags around emmet shortcuts, instead of around every word when pressing tab.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a directory `code ~/src/somedir`
2. Open a file with `code ~/src/otherdir/somefile --wait`

There doesn't seem to be a way to close just the wait window and have that return without closing vscode out completely.

It would be nice to be able to use this as my git editor/difftool, but can't do that with how it currently works.  I would expect that closing the only tab, or the CMD+Q would exit the current editor in the waiting state, not have to close down code completely.</Description>

    <Title>Add right-click menu to files in Search and Call Stack file listings</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.1 (1.13.1)
- OS Version: OS X 10.10.5

Both the Search Results and the Debug/Call Stack panes include listings of the found/involved files. However, I often finding myself wondering where the heck one of the listed files is. Is it in my code? Is it something in Node? Is it in an extension? The only way I've found is to open the file and then right-click on the file header, choosing "Reveal in Sidebar". It took me a while to find this (months, really), and is more indirect than it needs to be.

Feature request: add a right-click menu to each file name in the Search Results and Debug/Call Stack file listings. The menu would include everything relevant from the right-click menu on open file headers, which currently includes:

- Copy Path
- Reveal in Finder
- Reveal in Sidebar

Even better would be a way to view the path in situ, without having to switch contexts. Perhaps there could be a disabled "Path" menu item which shows the file path, or a hierarchical "Show Path" menu whose contents is just the file path (disabled). This could be added both to the file listings and to the current file header menu.

    <Title>Add ability to rename terminals</Title>
    <Description>It would be great to be able to change the name displayed in the terminals dropdown for each terminal.

This is a pretty common situation for me (which `bash` was the right one?):

&lt;img width="221" alt="screen shot 2017-07-07 at 15 37 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/27960122-642797b6-632a-11e7-8162-4e40a5c66b52.png"&gt;

It would be nice to have an `edit` button next to this select element, even a plain input reachable via an entry in the command palette would do it.

I believe it's possible to do this using the API, but I think it would be better to also have a more easily accessible option at hand.

That would be only when we clicked there. If we used the Command Palette it would work the way the current form does.



As for the search bar I would vote for being at the bottom (different from how the images are) next to the own status bar.

- OS Version: macOS Sierra

Steps to Reproduce:

Assuming you have an already working TypeScript project.
1. Create a faulty typescript file "file.ts" containing garbage in the root directory of your project
2. Run tsc -p in the same directory.

Actual Result:
You'll get some console logs like
```
37     faulty code
          ~~~~~~~~
file.ts(37,18): error XXXX: YYYY
```
The problem resides that normally you'd be getting a relative path (e.g. to the file causing the error), but that's not the case if the file is located in the root directory.</Description>

    <Title>Feature request: save open terminals with project</Title>
    <Description>It would be helpful if open inline terminals could be saved with project.
Example: I often have one terminal for the Bin directory, one for the Build directory, and several at various places in the source tree. Presently I have to always re-open the terminals after restarting Code.

Can we change the icon so that the middle of the symbol is not filled with white, and is instead see-through? I've attached some files I drew up of the new icon. One is actually a PNG the other is a .ico file disguised as a PNG because GitHub doesn't allow for the uploading of ICO files. Just change the extension and it should be fine.

---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code, edit TSX file
2. leave editor open, run "node install" in project
3. npm install takes over a minute longer than when not running VS Code,

NPM often hangs on a line such as this:

```
[       ...........] - extract:fsevents: verb lock using C:\Users\alshain\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache\_locks\staging-3d5cc763a76e1aa2.lock for c:\Users\alshain\Documents\typescript\node_modules\.staging
```

After a long wait time, npm will output something like (always EPERM, rename):

```
npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, rename 'c:\Users\alshain\Documents\typescript\.staging\fsevents-ca317142\node_modules\boom' -&gt; 'c:\Users\alshain\Documents\typescript\node_modules\.staging\boom-1ae2831a'
```

I'm not sure whether this is random, but VS Code seems not to acquire a lock in .staging very often when editing the settings for instance.

I was also able to confirm VS Code having a handle in .staging using process explorer a few times.

Once, I also got some kind of info popup in VS Code about it not being able to load completions or type definitions or whatever and it also mentioned a file inside the node_modules/.staging directory.

The problem *always* goes away when closing VS Code.

**Apparent fix**: adding this to my user settings:

        "**/.git/objects/**": true,

    <Title>Task runner fails on Windows if integrated shell path has a space</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.0-insider
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install PowerShell to a directory with a space in the path (I'm using PowerShell 6.0-beta.2, which by default installs to `C:/Program Files/PowerShell`).
2. Change `"terminal.integrated.shell.windows"` to point to this path (e.g. `C:/Program Files/PowerShell/powershell.exe`)
3. Try to run a task, either with `"isShellComand": true` or `"type": "shell"`. You should get an error message like the following:

```
Files/PowerShell/powershell.exe : The term 'Files/PowerShell/powershell.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ Files/PowerShell/powershell.exe -NoLogo -Command yarn start
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (Files/PowerShell/powershell.exe:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
```

Opening a terminal manually still works; the PowerShell extension also has no problems starting a session or opening its integrated console. It appears to only be an issue for the task runner.

Generic path-wrangling strategies (like escaping the space or double-wrapping the path in different flavors of quotemarks) either don't affect the behavior or break all of vscode's terminal operations (not just from the task runner).

Poking around the code, it looks to me like it might be an issue with [TerminalTaskSystem#resolveVariable](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/electron-browser/terminalTaskSystem.ts#L585) (which itself points indirectly to [ConfigurationResolverService#resolveString](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/services/configurationResolver/node/configurationResolverService.ts#L134)), since the path appears to be passed as a command to TerminalTaskSystem's internally created terminal. Take that with a grain of salt as I'm not very familiar with the codebase &amp; at the moment I don't have time to investigate further.

As a temporary (though less-than-ideal) workaround, I'm cloning the PS install up a level to C:/ and pointing the integrated terminal to that.

    <Title>Support projects (workspaces)</Title>
    <Description>It looks very strange that VS Code doesn't support ability to create and use projects. Workspace settings is a project settings. It's projects support already in this editor. But requires some polishing...

I found it uncomfortable for me to create new `.vscode` folder inside the source code directory. Some extensions put there own cache files. I don't like it (because if I work vis sshfs, then it means that each change of this cache file will be transferred, that I don't like to do).

It's why I propose to tune-up current workspace ideology and enable out-of-the-box projects support. All what you need - to create for each new project new folder in the `~/.vscode/` with appropriate local workspace `settings.json` file.

In the end, it will look like this:
```bash
~/.vscode/
    settings.json
    project1/
        settings.json
        cache_file_for_some_plugin
    project2/
        settings.json
```

This structure will work fine, because you have the same global setting for all projects, and local settings per project (workspace).

It will be good if you will make this change, and it will make life much easier out-of-the box.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. ctrl-p
2. search file that has similar names
3. order of the search may come back in an insane order

I have checked this with my colleague who is also using VS Code, but his search gives sane results. I have tried running VS Code with `--disable-extensions` but the results are still borked. Is there a way to clear the indexing of the search?

I'd expect to be able to copy a file from root folder A and paste it to root folder B. 
- The keyboard shortcuts (cmd+c cmd+v) work, but only within one folder. 
- After copying a file, right clicking the folder name and selecting paste works in its own root folder, but the paste option is grayed out for a different root folder.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a long-running terminal application in the integrated terminal
2. Press Ctrl-C

The terminal does not get a break signal; instead, a copy is attempted (and failed because there is not selection). I saw a message displayed once that the copy failed but I didn't screenshot it in time and I haven't seen it again.

I've checked my `keybindings.json` and there is nothing relevant there. The only relevant binding is the default binding:

    { "key": "ctrl+c",                "command": "workbench.action.terminal.copySelection",
                                      "when": "terminalFocus &amp;&amp; terminalTextSelected" },

Which shouldn't happen when `!terminalTextSelected` but appears to still happen instead of passing the binding through.

    <Title>Prelaunch task does not terminate</Title>
    <Description>testing #29447

Created an extension and upgraded the task.json to version 2.0.
After doing that the debugger waits for ever until the preLaunch task terminates.
When I terminate the task manually, then the target extension is launched properly.

When I change the compile script in package.json to not be watching, then the extension target launches correctly.

```
        "compile": "tsc -p ./",
```

my changes to the tasks.json

tasks.json
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",

    // we want to run npm
    "command": "npm",

    // the command is a shell script
    "type": "shell",
    
    // show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.
    "showOutput": "silent",

    // we run the custom script "compile" as defined in package.json
    "args": ["run", "compile", "--loglevel", "silent"],

    // The tsc compiler is started in watching mode
    "isBackground": true,

    // use the standard tsc in watch mode problem matcher to find compile problems in the output.
    "problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch"
}
```

Actually the preLaunch task does terminate as is shown in the console:

    <Description>The default file encoding cannot be set per programming language. This is a problem, because certain old languages force you to use old encodings.

Instead of manually having to reload the file in the correct encoding every time, I propose to allow the `files.encoding` setting to appear inside language specific settings.

```json
"[baan]": {
    "files.encoding": "iso88591"
}
```

When opening files of the types registered for the `baan` language, this would automatically set the file encoding to the specified value.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Resize the editor/file browser on the left
2. The ruler changes width randomly

This is a mild annoyance but depending on the size of the editor/file tree, the ruler's width will change from 1px to 2px, making it more noticeable than it needs to be on some occasions.

- OS Version: Mint 18.1 Cinnamon 64-bit
- Node.js debug

Hello guys. I have found funny bug - when trying to copy-paste debug console output, VS code select just what you see on the screen. If I try to resize debug console it still select just what you see, not the whole output.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a long array or object
2. Console-logify it.
3. Try copy and paste it from debug console.

---

Steps to Reproduce:

1.
Define the following task
```
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "python3",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["${file}"],
    "showOutput": "always"
}
```
2.
Invoke it on the following python program

```
import sys

print(sys.stdout.encoding)
print('🐞🐞')
```

Output is something along the lines of:

```
US-ASCII
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/pvg/src/pyxample/soupy.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    print('\U0001f41e\U0001f41e')
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: ordinal not in range(128)
```

Something similar happens in Windows as reported by an SO user here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44724461/task-output-encoding-in-vscode

Curiously, invoking the above program with 'Run Python File in Terminal' does not have this problem, the program produces the expected output and completes. 

It is possible to work around the task problem by setting an environment variable although that it feels like that should not be necessary (the option itself is rather poorly documented).

```
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "python3",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["${file}"],
    "showOutput": "always",
    "options": {
            "env": {
                "PYTHONIOENCODING":"utf-8"
            }
    }
}

    <Title>After first mouse click inside integrated terminal, Ctrl+C stops working until closing shell (regression)</Title>
    <Description>Version 1.14.0-insider
Commit 73015a5e052e6de8ecd60eed2670bea81fad8cac
Date 2017-06-16T05:13:31.107Z
Shell 1.6.6
Renderer 56.0.2924.87
Node 7.4.0

Starting with the update I got today, Ctrl+C is not working well anymore in the integrated terminal.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open terminal
2. Press Ctrl+C - it is working
3. Click somewhere inside the console area
4. Press Ctrl+C - it is not working anymore (until shell is restarted)

Note that this makes the terminal unusable because I can't cancel any operations, quit from REPL shells, etc. The only workaround so far is to switch to a second shell which is not yet affected, then switch back, and then Ctrl+C will work exactly one time (see point 5b below).

Additional things I observed:
1. It happens also with `--disable-extensions`.
2. It is triggered by clicking inside the console area only. Moving focus doesn't affect it, clicking anywhere else doesn't affect it either. For example, it is possible to click into the editor and then move focus back to the terminal by clicking the "Terminal" text in its tab bar instead of clicking into the actual console area, or by using Ctrl+M and Tab, and it will not become broken.
3. There is no way to get a specific shell session back to a working state other than closing/killing it (at least not permanently, see point 5b below).
4. Only Ctrl+C appears affected. I found other control key combinations such as Ctrl+R and Ctrl+X still working.
5. When using multiple terminal sessions, I observed the following behavior (marking affected terminals with single quote):
  a. When moving from an affected terminal A' to a non-affected terminal B, the first Ctrl+C will not work, **displaying a message "Warn - The terminal has no selection to copy"** (I guess that's a hint to the source of the bug), but subsequent Ctrl+C presses will work.
  b. When moving from a non-affected terminal A to an affected terminal B', the first Ctrl+C *will* work, but subsequent Ctrl+C presses will not.
  c. When moving from an affected terminal A' to another affected terminal B', no special behavior occurs (it keeps being broken). Similarly, when moving from a non-affected terminal A to another non-affected terminal B, it keeps working.
6. When actually selecting something in the terminal and then pressing Ctrl+C to _copy_ it, the copy works, but it does not repair the terminal. Also, the selection is not cleared then - I'm not entirely sure about that but I think I remember that in the past it was cleared on copy.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open any source file that requires scrolling
2. with minimap enabled, click an area of the map that is not under the shadow, and hold the click
3. while still holding the click, try to drag the shadow to a desired area

The expected behavior is to be able to drag the shadow up and down, as you are able to do with the regular scroll bar. However when following the above steps, the shadow is not automatically selected after the scroll position jumps to the area that you initially click in step 2. Instead you have to release and reclick to have the shadow be selected.</Description>

2.The approach makes these 3 options ("Go","Debug","Help") inaccessible as they are cover by "View"

With yesterday's fixes, Emmet at least doesn't try to put HTML tags into SCSS, this is good.
Now for the (very) bad. Ussing Emmet with SCSS is just very painful.

Say, I type `margin` in SCSS and press TAB. I expect something like `margin: `, instead I get (from Emmet): `max-resolution: ;`

From `border` and TAB I get: `background-origin: padding-box;`

Fom `padding` and TAB I get: `page-break-after: auto;`. This is very bad, on the border of uselessness.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open any SCSS file
2. Try to type "abc" and  then TAB. You'll get an absolutely useless `&lt;abc&gt;&lt;/abc&gt;`.

I tried to disable Emmet in settings, first only for the SCSS files and then altogether, since Emmet is starting to get into my nerves a bit :)

I tired:
`"emmet.excludeLanguages": [
        "markdown", "scss", "sass", "css"
    ],`

and then:
`"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": false`

    <Title>[Accessibility] Magnifier Focus Tracking Not Working</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)

For a screen magnifier user, it is important that text editors notify the accessibility API of caret position changes, so that the magnified view can follow the caret while e.g. writing code. This is not the case in VS Code, regardless of the editor.accessibility setting.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launch the Windows screen magnifier by pressing Win and +.
2. In magnifier settings, enable caret tracking if it isn't enabled - "have magnifier follow the text insertion point".
3. Open any file in VS Code.
4. Zoom in to say 4X magnification.
5. Type or use the arrow keys to move the caret off the screen.

What happens? The caret continues moving outside the visible magnified view.
What should happen? The magnified view should follow the caret so that it is never off-screen. For an example of correct behaviour, try the steps above in notepad.</Description>

    <Title>Error: The mode has failed while tokenizing the input</Title>
    <Description>VSCode Version: code-insiders_1.14.0-1498021996_amd64.deb
OS VErsion: Debian GNU/Linux 7.11

Steps to Reproduce:

Edit any file
You should then see an error popup, and you see this on the window gaining focus:

"The mode has failed while tokenizing the input"

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Have also tried the same with the standard vs code (not insiders). Have also tried the trick mentioned in other forums to no avail (sudo rm -rf /usr/share/code/resources/app/node_modules/vscode-textmate/node_modules).

Any suggestions? Many thanks

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Turn on git's three-way conflict output: `git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3`
2. Create a merge conflict.
3. View the conflicting file in VS Code.

The current feature sees the parent section (`||||||| merged common ancestors` and the following lines) as part of the "current change", as opposed to a separate version of the code. This means that e.g. "Accept current change" doesn't work as intended.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Change `editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity` to something extreme, like 20
2. Restart vscode (just to make sure the setting is applied)
3. Turn the scroll wheel

Expected behavior:

It should scroll by much more than it used to.

Actual behavior:

Scrolling didn't change compared to the default settings.</Description>

- *Expected result*: When I press F5, VS Code runs npm run compile and then starts debugger.
- *Actual result*:
    - When I press F5 first time VS Code just compiles and doesn't start debugger, just showing a spinning line in the status bar.
    - Subsequent attempts to run actually starts debugger and work as expected.
    - When I execute "Terminate running task" command I get error message:

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Open Source Control tab, click modified file (`a.txt`) to open diff editor, write commit message and commit
3. Back to Explorer tab, modify `a.txt` again
4. See modified file(`a.txt`) again, the last time commited change stays in the diff editor

It seems I must close the diff editor manually and reopen it to solve the problem.

So, I ran the command pictured below, which was supposed to print a whole bunch of lines, but because I'm an idiot it printed all the items on one line with a whole lot of literal '\n's between them:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6175424/27249722-f7241eb4-52d0-11e7-9197-a056df4933bc.png)

However, printing said lines caused VS Code to completely lock up, and I had to kill it.  After some testing, I discovered the following in the CPU profiler:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6175424/27249748-65c2c406-52d1-11e7-87c7-f8f90848c124.png)

These are the results after running the profiler for about 10 seconds while VS Code was frozen.  The first line reveals something interesting:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6175424/27249779-01c89984-52d2-11e7-9021-463f0fb903cd.png)

It appears that Linkifier is using a backtracking regular expression to detect links on a single line of the terminal, which, for a line as long as the one I printed, causes the entire window to freeze for several minutes.</Description>

    <Title>Feature Request: render emoji in Markdown Preview</Title>
    <Description>It'd be great if the VS Code Markdown preview rendered emoji. I have a simple 2 line change (https://github.com/beyang/vscode/tree/markdown-emoji) that enables this functionality.

Here's what it looks like currently:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1646931/27248658-b9b7a97a-52bb-11e7-9dd7-e94f2c297959.png)

And here's what it looks like on my branch:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1646931/27248667-cba08ba2-52bb-11e7-940b-dd1d9481ebab.png)

This could also be implemented using the proposed Markdown extension API (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22916), but that is still in the works and meanwhile emoji use in Markdown is widespread :). Happy to open a PR to quickly fix this issue or close it if the preference is to wait for the Markdown API.</Description>

    <Title>Feature Request: Execute highlighted code when debugging</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393

This is a feature request. It's a request to implement what the Chrome developer tools has. Currently, if you are debugged at a point in the JS code, you can highlight some code and when you mouse-over the code, it will execute it and show you the results. It's really useful and faster than copying and pasting into the debug console of VS Code. Here's what I'm talking about:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/791996/27241065-1089e630-528c-11e7-9ab7-7376b731b069.png)

You can see that the web app is currently paused at line number 344 and `11 + 11` is highlighted. When I mouse over, a popup comes up and shows me the output. This would be really cool for debugging NodeJS or Chrome in VSCode.

Everything else works fine.  VS Code is the only thing throwing up on this.

## - Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to File, Open Folder.
3. Look for the OneDrive folder and click OK
4. Error comes out: Path doesn't exist!!

Even, if you mapped to shared folder on OneDrive it still gives the error.
This is not happening with any other IDE editors: 

## - Big FYI!!!  -&gt; This started to happened after Windows 10 Build 16215 had a recent OneDrive update this week.

    <Title>import intellisense not working v1.11.2 or higher</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.11.2 and higher (now 1.13.1)
- OS Version: Windows 10 x64, macOS 12

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a angular 2(4) or Ionic 2 project.
2. Type `import`, and select `import statement` on the hint list, then it generates import template like bellow:
` import {  } from "module";`
3. Once typed any text in the `"module"`, it shows module list related with the text (This is what I expected, and worked less than v1.10.2), but not working newest version. 

Here are the screenshots I faced.

New version( v1.11.2 or higher)

Old version(v1.10.2 or lower), what I expected

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Ensure you have MiniMaps enabled in settings 
2. Right click on a function and select 'Go to Definition' from the right click menu
3. When the 'Peek Definition' panel pops up, click the 'X' in the top right corner of the pop-up panel.
4. The MiniMap should disappear from the currently active document

Closing the document and opening it again usually solves the problem</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run command to edit a file not owned by the current user, like `code /etc/hosts`
2. Save the file
3. See error
&gt; Failed to save 'hosts': A system error occured (EACCES: permission denied, open '/private/etc/hosts')

Previously, VS Code seemed to handle this scenario properly by opening a window asking for admin user/password to escalate the save command. If I'm incorrect, apologies. The only other issues I see on this have proposed solutions that involve changing the owner of the files, which is not a correct fix, particularly in this scenario.</Description>

    <Title>Find-all-references preview broken in insiders</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.14.0-insider
- OS Version: Linux Mint 18

Steps to Reproduce:

Type:
```ts
function f() {}
// Put a lot of blank lines here. Or put it in a different file.
f();
```

1. Find-all-references for `f` in `function f() {}`
2. Click on the second result (the call `f();`)
3. I expect to see a preview of the use. Instead I am still looking at `function f() {}`. This does not happen in vscode 1.13.1.

    <Title>Feature request: Map ts files automatically in Visual Studio Code</Title>
    <Description>Actually I am using Version 1.13.1.
When running a typescript project, call stack links are printed out as link to a location in the transpiled js file.
```
at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/work/app/dist/main.js:46:7)
```
It would be useful that user can configure, if such links are translated automatically to their typescript source file location, using the mapping file available in the project.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Ctrl+N, add some lines
2. Ctrl+F (don't need to actually search for anything but leave the find box open)
3. Ctrl+G and type a line number (pressing enter is optional to see the bug)
4. Observe that a blank space is added at the top of the editor (it scrolls out of view if you have enough lines to scroll; closing the find box gets rid of this space)

    <Title>Git diff view gets stuck on previous diff</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.13.0
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Not sure if related or required, but follow steps to replicate #28761
2. With the bugged/opened diff view still open, make and save another change to the same file
3. Click on the change again in Source Control: it should still show the previous diff

The only way to correct this is to manually close the stale diff and click on the change again.

    <Title>Feature Request: Add Setting to open VS Code without default unsaved tab being opened [closed as duplicate]</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.13.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Close all files/tabs in VS code.
2. Close VS code.
3. Open VS code.

The application will open up with a default `Untitled-1` tab already open that you can start typing into.
It would be nice to have a setting that allows VS Code to start without opening any tabs. e.g. it looks like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1187140/27140993-40ef410c-50e4-11e7-995c-36b82fbf0e52.png)

The reason this is desirable is I often open VS Code and then open the file I'm after, by using Ctrl+O or the `File -&gt; Open Recent` menu. This means always having to close the default tab that VS code opened when it started, which is annoying.

Alternatively, you could perhaps still have the default blank tab open with VS Code, but close it automatically once any other file is opened and that tab is still blank.</Description>

If I use the integrated terminal for executing _watch_ scripts, or any _background_ running tasks, shouldn't it terminate automatically upon closing vscode?
Steps to Reproduce:
For simplicity, create a [CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app and open it in vscode. 
1. Open the Integrated Terminal and execute `npm start`
2. Close the vscode window and try to access `http://localhost:3000`.  

It doesn't have to be a [CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app. Try running `express` or a http server instance.</Description>

    <Title>version 1.13 and ohmyzsh integrated terminal flickering branches</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.13
- OS Version: Debian 8

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use oh my zsh and integrated terminal
2. Notice how in your git repo you will see folderpath branch:branch (why showing branches 2times)
3. Notice how when you start typing in integrated terminal it will stop displaying branch 2 times but rather once

This removing and adding of branch name causes flickering since it happens on an time scale of &gt; 1s. 

Can't find any change description in https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_13#_changed-setting-defaults that would cause this.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.0

I suggest you make the info in the About modal copyable so it can be easily pasted into an issue and update the issue template to ask for this info copied verbatim instead of the list with VS Code version and OS version. Intending to replace both, the About modal should also contain OS version.

It can either be made a readonly text field, or better yet a Copy to Clipboard button could be added to save the user a mouse drag.</Description>

    <Title>Integrated terminal redraws $PS1 repeatedly while typing</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.13
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.5, Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS

Other env config:
- Shell: zsh
- Shell manager: oh-my-zsh + powerlevel9k

Steps to Reproduce:

1. I have left and right side zsh utilities in place
2. An extra path is added after the $PS1 when not typing
2.a this is a copy of the displayed path
2.b only the last two dir paths are displayed, these are duplicated in the shell when not typing

example of desired:
```console
.../parent-dir/current-dir &gt;
```

example after upgrade to 1.13 (shell operates correctly pre 1.13 and system terminals):
```console
.../parent-dir/current-dir/parent-dir/current-dir &gt;
```

3. start typing and the $PS1 reverts to normal (only while typing characters)
3.a this causes a flipflop between `.../parent-dir/current-dir` and `.../parent-dir/current-dir/parent-dir/current-dir` while typing.

I haven't tracked down yet where the conflict is coming from, i.e. is it zsh, oh-my-zsh, or powerlevel9k. Something did change after the 1.13 release, as there were no issues before with the same configuration.

Is there any way gives me about binary file info instead of “The file will not be displayed in the editor because it is either binary, very large or uses an unsupported test encoding.” ?

Just gives me something about the file stat infomation and so on. I think it is very nice.

After i installed it the icons look okay but after some restarts they look like in the following screens.
Cant fix it with restarts. I have no graphic issues with any other app. Any idea what could be related to this?

    <Title>tmux pane_current_path is duplicated</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.13.0 (1.13.0)
- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.5
- extensions: occurs even when I run code with `--disable-extensions`

Steps to Reproduce:

1. put this in `.tmux.conf`:
```
set -g pane-border-format "#{pane_index} #{pane_current_path} "
setw -g pane-border-status bottom

```
2. start a terminal in VSCode
3. in the terminal start tmux
```
tmux new-session -s test
```

Now, in the pane status line I expect to see the current path, e.g. `-0 /Users/klas.mellbourn ---`. 

Instead it looks like this `-/Users/klas.mellburn-0 /User/klas.mellbourn ---`. 
It seems that the current path and a dash is prepended to the expected pane title.

This occurs for both `bash` and `zsh`.

This occurs _only_ for the first pane. If I split the tmux session into to panes beside each other, the second pane gets the expected title `-1 /User/klas.mellbourn --`. However, the title for the second pane is positioned incorrectly horizontally. It is offset to the right by the size of the string `/Users/klas.mellbourn` as if tmux did not expect it to be shown.

This occurs _only_ within Visual Studio code. The pane title behaves just as expected in terminals (such as `iTerm` or the built in `terminal`) outside Visual Studio Code.</Description>

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open **VSCode** (**PowerShell** is configured as internal terminal)
2. ``Ctrl + ` `` to open the terminal
3. Observe that the terminal is wrapped after **80 characters**

    <Title>Add Project Manager extension to VS Code</Title>
    <Description>I think that Projects ideology should be in a heart of the VS Code. The main reason for it it that we can have a dedicated folder for each project where we can save project settings (including workspace settings), cache files (for example for file tree to make Go To File super fast and save cache between VS Code reloads), to save cache of external plugins (like such as Python, that saves and uses cache for Go To Symbol In workspace).

Please discuss this decision again in your core team. Because I see that it should be implemented, and all what you need is to take the already existing extension and inject it into the native VS Code build.

Thank you for improvements.

I did not find an option enable this behavior in Code, I assume it is not there. I suggest implementing this. It helps a lot when navigating the file. Personally I see no benefit in the default behavior of only showing it on mouse-over since this actively reduces the usefulness of the minimap.</Description>

- Commit hash: 376c52b955428d205459bea6619fc161fc8faacf

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a two `.scss` files (eg. `main.scss` and `_part.scss`)
2. In `_part.scss` make a new variable (eg: `$color`: "blue");
3. In `main.scss` make a call to the variable, like `.color { background: $color; }`
4. Click on `$color` while holding down `ctrl` in `main.scss`. This opens the definition box for `$color`. But when it is closed (or clicking anywhere), the minimap on the right disappears

To show the minimap again, restart VS Code

    <Title>Feature request: vscode.CompletionItem::documentation should support markdown</Title>
    <Description>This has bugged me since a while, and I just saw the new [Suggestion list and documentation side by side](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_13#_suggestion-list-and-documentation-side-by-side) feature in the 1.13.0 release notes and was hoping this would also finally enable markdown, but unfortunately that's not the case. It's even visible in the demo gif in the release notes where links are not formatted.

I'm [writing an autocomplete extension](https://github.com/simonvizzini/vscode-factorio-lua-api-autocomplete) and have this problem:

This looks nice and is helpful ``vscode.Hover``:

![nice-tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10862380/27003351-1b2e0904-4df5-11e7-9a96-6578ca24e5a0.png)

But this not so much ``vscode.CompletionItem``:

![ugly-tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10862380/27003353-2bcd5576-4df5-11e7-931b-08df12e0dd88.png)

Prior to 1.13.0 there was also no horizontal scrollbar and the lack of space doesn't make it easy to read.

Please consider also enabling markdown for CompletionItems. That would be really helpful. Thanks!</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. From Windows, use Ctrl-Shift-C to trigger "Open New Command Prompt" which should launch a cmd.exe window.
2. Run a command and try to kill it with Ctrl-C

Specifically, I'm doing `gulp-watch` which runs a browsersync server. When I open cmd normally and navigate to the same folder, I can run `gulp-watch` and quickly kill it with `Ctrl-C` like I always have. Using "Open New Command Prompt" makes is so the `Ctrl-C` shortcut just copies the selected text (even if there is no selection). I tried this out by making sure I had text in my clipboard and then went back to the window and did a `Ctrl-C` -- when I pasted there was nothing in the clipboard.

Any thoughts?

    <Title>Add an API for showing Wizards and Dialog Boxes</Title>
    <Description>Currently, in order to get any information from the user, an extension has the following options:
* `showInputBox()`
* `showQuickPick()`

Both of those methods allow getting a single piece of information. (as opposed to a form containing multiple fields for the user to fill in)

While this is particularly efficient for getting simple data. (e.g. a "Rename" command might use `showInputBox()` to get the new name of a variable) it is (IMHO) rather inconvenient for getting more complex information.

For instance, if an extension wants to show a "wizard" that creates a new project in the currently open directory, an intuitive way would be to show a "window" that allows the user to fill in such parameters as:
1. Project name
1. The version of the language/standard to use
1. Project template
1. etc.

Since, VSCode doesn't provide an API for showing custom windows, the only way for getting these information would be to show consecutive input boxes. (using `showInputBox()`)
This means:
1. The user has to remember what they have entered
1. If the user remembers making a mistake in a previously validated input box, they have to cancel and start over

A concrete example of such behavior can be seen in the [yo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samverschueren.yo) extension.

Having all the fields displayed simultaneously would allow the user to:
1. Write AND correct themselves without having to start all over each time they make a mistake
1. Have a recap of all the information that has been entered and make changes if needed

Some extensions (e.g. [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)) are working around this limitation by:
1. Showing an HTML page that contains input fields, buttons, etc. (implementing `TextDocumentContentProvider`)
1. Getting the information back using an HTTP server and WebSockets
1. (Perhaps, I haven't checked, but seems doable) Updating the content of the HTML page if needed

Clever!
I think, however, that it would be better if VSCode provided some API for showing simple, custom windows that would (at least) allow getting multiple data at once.

Some ideas:
* `showForm([{fieldName: "name", fieldType: "type"}...], okCallback, cancelCallback)`
* `showDialog(message, okCallback)`
* `showFancyWindow(be, creative)`</Description>

    <Title>PHP Strings on New Lines After Quotes are Broken</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.13.0
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.4

Since updating to VSCode 1.13.0, when writing PHP, strings that are opened on one line, then continued on another line, are no longer read as a single string, but rather for some reason it seems to think the new line has terminated the string.

    <Title>Open same folder in two different Visual Studio Sessions</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.0 (376c52b955428d205459bea6619fc161fc8faacf, 2017-06-08T16:43:13.058Z)

Before the last update I used to be able to open two sessions of Visual Studio and point them at the same folder.  Now a "feature" has been added to just switch to the existing Visual Studio.  I understand that there are split windows that I can use but this is not nearly as efficient for me as the two open studio sessions to the same folder.  My work around is to open the root folder in one session and the source folder in the second.  I would suggest that the check for an existing Visual Studio session needs to be removed as this is reducing the functionality.
---

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Open a folder with Visual Studio
2.  press cntl-shft-n for a new window.
3.  Open the same folder as the existing Visual Studio session.
4.  The result is that the first Visual Studio Session is brought into focus and the new session is still blank.</Description>

It would be really powerful and flexible to be able to search using the common inline search widget (ctrl+f) in the Terminal window, Debug Console, Output, Problems window as if they were common Editors.
The same would be nice for the Extension windows, the screen that shows the information about an extension has no way to search text.

If any of you has ever worked with emacs, you'd probably know the advantadges of being able to search anywhere.

Thank you and congrats for this geat editor.</Description>

Hey all - **so cool** that we can do some user interface work now! I [built an extension straight away](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-react-native-storybooks)

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49038/26970386-1a86fb18-4d01-11e7-8929-4c79b7a95101.gif)

This extension is only really useful for a few of the projects I work on daily, and so I was hoping that because it has a pretty limited set of activation events the section for Storybooks would only show in the cases of the activation. If I can't give it a provider, then there's not much that can be done with the UI.</Description>

    <Title>Intellisense for class methods is not working</Title>
    <Description>When I create a class by extending another class or implementing an interface, the editor doesn't offer any helpful suggestions.

Typescript Service can show an error when abstract methods are not implemented, or if method signature is incorrect, but there is no help from the editor when I'm in the process of implementing the class.

An obvious example of this is implementing React Components. I expect that when I trigger suggest within the class implementation, I would see all of ComponentLifecycle methods with their signatures. However, when I invoke the suggest widget, it shows a host of things in there, none of which are helpful, and none of those I need are actually present.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong? I tried it with the new TypeScript-React-Starter project, but the behavior was the same.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Try Moving the Terminal/Debug Console to another location on the screen.
2.Look at ISE and which it worked in VS code

Would it be possible to get the Terminal/Debug Console/etc to be able to "unlock" from its current location and be able to position it anywhere on the screen(s) or re-arrange inside the main window.

I'm using this setting:
```
"javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs": true
```
This is something WOW, I even deleted Flow and not using it anymore, but left only this annoying problem, I can't add properties in req object....

However I can create it and no error/warning:

```
req.userId = decodedToken.userId;
```

But then I'm trying to use it in one of my routes I get the problem.

```
Property 'userId' does not exist on type 'Request',
```

But you can add properties in req object in your middleware, even Express is documented it https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.param. I can't use locals or to add it directly. I know it's definitions, but since this is VS Code I don't know where I need to open an issue.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In a large repo like Chromium, open Quick open (CTRL+P).
2. Enter a search term, e.g. 'arc'.
3. While the search proceeds in the background (running blue bar indicator shows), select an item other than the first (arrow up/down).
4. Wait until the search finishes.

Expected: The same item is still selected.
Actual: The selection resets and the first item is selected.

This often leads to opening the wrong item when the search finishes right in the moment when one hits enter.</Description>

    <Title>Entering and leaving directory statements are not processed, resulting in incorrect paths for the problemMatcher</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.12
- OS Version: Mac OS 10.12.5 &amp; Ubuntu 16.04
Steps to Reproduce:

1. download e.g. bash source code from GitHub
2. In top source dir mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make 
If the make is done from within studio code, it can be seen that some paths to warnings are resolved properly, but others, to files in sub projects not.
All reported paths are relative to the current working directory, however this directory changes during the build process. This change of directory is reported with statements like:
make[1]: Leaving directory '/media/psf/Home/GitHub/bash/bash-4.4/build/builtins'
make[1]: Entering directory '/media/psf/Home/GitHub/bash/bash-4.4/build/support'
In this kind of environment which is not that uncommon, it seems kind of impossible to get the problem matcher working properly. Depending on the area you are working on you have to edit the tasks file to get a correct link to the file.
To complicate things more the leaving statements pops back to the previous one, so if you parse the entering and leaving statements, it is not stateless. You have to keep track of a stack of directories.</Description>

1. Change workspace integrated terminal to something different: eg `"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"`
2. Open an integrated terminal ``ctrl+` ``
3. Integrated terminal still has the terminal configured in user settings (In my case I have `bash.exe` as my user terminal and made an attempt to set a workspace setting for another executable for a different bash and also did a sanity check with PowerShell)</Description>

VS Code seems to cache the icons for the explorer view by filename. This can cause issues if you create a file, delete it and create a folder with the same name again (or create a folder, delete it and create a file with the same name).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a file with the name `test`
2. Delete the file
3. Create a folder in the same location with the same name as the file

    <Title>VS Code "still" won't open in xrdp session</Title>

- VSCode Version: 1.13.0 (insiders)
- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04.2

See Closed incident #12233 
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12233

OK! Its May 27th, 2017 and I would have expect by now that VS Code (and Insiders) would already work using xrpd. But, it isn't!!

This issue still Open as the workaround a permanent resolution as we need to manually fixed it.
How about integrating the workaround steps into the installation steps?

I shortcut the steps to:
## - Fix to make VS Code work in xrdp:
sudo su
     sudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1
     sudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1.1.0
exit

## - for VS Code Insiders:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib code-insiders
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 /usr/share/code-insiders
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1.1.0 /usr/share/code-insiders

## - for VS Code:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib code
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 /usr/share/code
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1.1.0 /usr/share/code

    <Title>Files Opened Through Git Panel (Working Tree) Aren't In Temporary Editor</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version: 10.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Git Panel
1. Click on a file with changes
1. Click on another file with changes
1. Note that two Working Tree editors are now opened, instead of the second file replacing the first

It'd be preferable if the Keep Editor commands (saving, pressing cmd+K Enter) would work here, and the files would otherwise open over one another in the same editor (likely with a setting to always keep working tree files, if users like that behavior). 

Finding myself spending a lot of cycles closing Working Tree tabs as it stands now, this would be a nice QOL change.

Thanks as always!

Best

    <Title>Npm module debug not showing up in vscode debugging console</Title>
    <Description>
- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version:  Debian Stretch

Steps to Reproduce:

1. make app.js

```
    'use strict';
    var debug = require('debug')('myapp:test');
    console.log('DEBUG is', process.env.DEBUG);
    console.log('NODE_ENV is', process.env.NODE_ENV);
    debug("foo");
```

2. in vscode left panel click on DEBUG and configure launch.json

```
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Programm starten",
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.js",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "env": {
        "DEBUG":"myapp:*",
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    }
```

3. click on green arrow (Start debug) will show only

    DEBUG is myapp:*
    NODE_ENV is development

4. on console (or even in vscode terminal) the following command will give full output (in color! yeah)

```
    $ DEBUG="myapp:*" node app.js

    DEBUG is myapp:*
    NODE_ENV is development
    myapp:test foo +0ms
```

Conclusion: There is no information from npm debug module, when started via debug.

Remark: NODE_ENV variable is not necessary, but I wanted to rule out, that debug will not be blocked, by thinking it is in production...

I'm using the Slime theme and noticed really bad contrast when debugging in the status bar.
I wanted to fix that but unfortunately it is not possible to set a dedicated foreground debugging color like for the background. Would it be possible to add something like that?

    <Title>VSCode is sometimes blurry on multiple displays as does not respect per-monitor DPI settings</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version: Windows Pro 10 x64 creators update (10.0.15603)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set up environment with two monitors - primary being 100% DPI scaling and second being higher DPI (i.e. 200%) - a sample setup is HiDPI laptop (such as all Surface devices) with external monitor, where external monitor is the primary display device
2. Log out and log in or restart OS to apply DPI settings completely
3. Run vscode move it to the secondary screen with &gt;100% DPI settings

At this point vscode window is scaled up.

It is worth noting that if the primary screen has 200% DPI (i.e. if Surface built-in screen is the primary display, or was primary display at the time the user has logged in), then vscode is not blurry - but then it is downscaled when moving it to the primary monitor.

I believe this is because vscode windows are set to use `PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE` setting - which makes it use the DPI setting of the primary monitor, not the display it is currently at.

As vscode uses electron, which in turn uses webkit, it should be possible to use `PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE` setting - since chrome does support it properly for quite a while - chrome windows scale properly to each monitor's DPI settings.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. make a UTF-8 context as the following two line:
一二三四五 12345
1234567890abcdef
2. make the cursor at Ln1, Col8 between '1' and '2' in Line 1.
3. press keyboard's key, "down", to go to the next line.
4. now, the cursor is at Ln2, Col8 between '7' and '8' in Line 2.
5. but I expected the cursor is at Ln2, Col13 between 'b' and 'c' in Line 2.

This is because there are 5 "double width words" in line 1, and the cursor's moving behavior depends on word counting but not its location (millimeter or pixel is good, but maybe bytes is not bad.) After all, the cursor is human's utility for entering words for its main job, not for counting words. By the way, status bar of sublime text shows "words" but not "location", it is bad. =(

And, it is important for multiselecting by keyboard when working on having "difference width words" context.

Hi I am having problems with Javascript within my project. I have 5 javascript files and I use module revealing pattern. For some reason actions like "Find All References" does not work. It works fine for the same project when I use WebStorm. I tried the same project on another computer with fresh VSC installation and got the same issue. Is this normal?</Description>

|material-icon-theme|PKief|2.0.6|
|stylelint|shinnn|0.24.0|

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Open "Go to File..." menu.
1. Type pattern to find a file.
1. For some files the search list contains the file twice.
1. The duplicate will be opened in a separate tab. The tab tooltip shows that the path is different from original one in the case, e.g. the original path is "C:\Projects\Project\file.ts" but the duplicate has "C:\projects\project\file.ts".

Expected
The files should be presented once in the list and the paths should correspond to OS ones.

Is there a way to fix it? As that behavior often leads me to a difference in the content of same file if I use "Go to File..." to switch between tabs. And I cannot determine the path difference in recently opened list.

Notes
* If I try to find files by pattern containing folder name, e.g. "proj file", then the recently opened list is empty and the file results one contains the single match (no duplicate).
* I tried to clear the recent files, no success.
* I tried to disable all extensions, no success.</Description>

    <Title>Autocompletion API doesn't allow adding words</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version: Mac OS 10.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install all-autocomplete extension
1. Edit any code where you would expect either snippets or intellisense to be offered - you can only see the word completions.
1. This has been discussed in #4791 but the reporter closed it

It seems that the current completion API doesn't allow for **adding** entries to the list, which is a problem, since any specialized completion plugins would only focus on their own domain, assuming the "other" completions are preserved. For example, `all-autocomplete` extension provides much missing feature of completing words from other open files (typical in many modern editors).

If there is a way to use the API so that the extension can add its own entries to the list, please let @atishay know so he can update the plugin. Or please treat this as an enhancement request to allow that.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open editor and zoom out (using shortcut or from View menu)
2. On a blank line, type some text (example: 123456789012345...)
3. When typing, the cursor is shown shifting some pixel to the right than the actual position. (It is more noticeable after writing 10-15 characters).

Cursor is shifting proportionally to the actual cursor position; the higher the number of characters the cursor is away from left side, the cursor is shifting more to the right.

In the following image, the cursor is actually at the end of line but showing before the last character:

VCode should have an option to sign in with Outlook.com/hotmail account and all config should be able to sync across multiple installations though user profile. Option to also create multiple configs like Home Config, Weekend Config or Office Config and easier way to switch.

Lot of times we do some coding in office and switch laptop or use a bigger desktop in home. It would be really easy to sync rather than the Github hack sync way of doing the same.

    <Title>Recently opened files includes deleted files</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In any project, open a file that exists (let's call it `foo.txt`).
2. Close VS Code.
3. Delete `foo.txt` from your file system.
4. Open VS Code.
5. Use quick open to search for the name of a file. A result will appear but if you try to open it, an error will happen `Unable to open 'foo.txt': File not found (/Users/.../foo.txt).`
6. Repeating step 5 multiple times the same thing happens.

I actually can't reproduce step (6) any more but I got into this state somehow. When I try to reproduce it seems to correctly eliminate the file after the first error.

Either way, it would be nice if VS Code removes files from the recently opened list that were deleted.</Description>

    <Title>x64 VSCode for Windows</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.2
- OS Version: Windows 10 x64

Can we have 64-bits version of VSCode?

Reasons:

- Chrome and Node.js depend on V8 which has a JIT compiler. 32-bits version of V8 can only generate ia32 native code. 64-bits version of V8 can generate faster SIMD native code and not all of it is available in 32-bits (like AVX1 and AVX2). Since VSCode spends quite a large portion of time running JS code, there will a performance win to use x64 JIT compiler.
- In order to improve stability, performance, and security, Chrome automatically migrates to 64-bits Chrome for 64-bits OS users with more than 4GB RAM but use 32-bits Chrome. VSCode is unlikely to be attacked, but who can refuse more security and stability? [Reference](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_9.html)
- [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) provides both 32-bits and 64-bits executable for Windows.

Experiment:

- Download [prebuilt electron-v1.7.0-win32-x64](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.6.10/electron-v1.6.10-win32-x64.zip) and place it under `C:\electron`.
- Copy `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app` to `C:\electron\resources\app`
 - Launch `C:\electron\electron.exe`.

It did launch the outer UI of VSCode, it even picked up the editor theme of my original VSCode, but no content was shown.

I opened the developer tool and found the bug: some node.js modules are native addons built as 32-bits    .node (.dll) which is not compatible with 64-bits program. This can be configured in `node-gyp` to build 64-bits binaries.

What is the main concern not doing this?</Description>

I did a search for this issue and found this closed issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7898 which seems to be the same problem.

This is obviously for an other version of Code and on an other OS.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. This works fine: `![Test image](images/test_image.svg)` as long as `test_image.svg` exists
2. Replace the underscore with a whitespace and rename the file accordingly, now it just shows `![Test image](images/test image.svg)` in the preview i.e. just the text, no image.</Description>

    <Title>Found Modules or Symbols no longer have IntelliSense priority [BUG]</Title>
    <Description># Description
When importing a symbol from another module, IntelliSense detects importable modules.
Before 1.12.1 found modules or symbols (of modules) were prioritized in the suggestion display, as of 1.12.1, they no longer are.
Code snippets now seem to have the same priority, and all suggestions are sorted alphabetically.

If **nothing was typed yet**, symbol suggestions are prioritized as expected, modules are still ordered alphabetically.

# Spec information
- VSCode Version:
1.12.1 &amp; 1.12.2
- OS Version:
Ubuntu 16.04 x64

# Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create any typescript module with any exported symbol
2. Import the symbol from another typescript file

    <Title>php folding with heredoc</Title>
    <Description>when trying to fold a function with heredoc text this will only hide the lines before the heredoc text.

Sample:

```
function Test() 
{
    print_r("Sample function for testing folding with heredoc...\r\n");
    $text = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOT
This is a sample text
just to get some lines
for showing the problem
when folding a function
with heredoc text.
EOT;
    print_r("$text\r\n");
}
```

After folding:

```
function Test() 
{...
This is a sample text
just to get some lines
for showing the problem
when folding a function
with heredoc text.
EOT;
    print_r("$text\r\n");

Can we have "Add to .gitignore" on the list for non tracked files?

@alexandrudima sending directly to you but fell free to push back/ask others etc.

I also appreciate that menu is getting long :)  And with a default setting [assuming we adopt it] discover-ability is less of an issue.  But this does give a nice way to turn it both on and off.

I use a the fish shell with nvm, so npm isn't available in my path until I run `npm`, `node`, or `nvm`. I've setup a script at `~/bin/npm` to work around this, but no way to specify vscode to use it, as that is a custom path that my dotfiles adds.

If vscode uses node, it may benefit from [safeps](https://github.com/bevry/safeps/blob/0e7cff711aeea93bafbf5d35869dd9c1271226c9/source/index.js#L1075-L1140) which has code in there to determine an executables path across many different environments.</Description>

This is ideas and requests for the current extensions organization.
1. When I have many installed extensions, I can hardly remember my appraise for them and reason for disabling. This can be improved if we have customizable categorys (directory) / tags, or integrated reviews of marketplace or provide comment field.
2. Sometimes I like some extensions's ideas or features, but don't intend to use it for now, I have to install and disable it for recollect, or manually list them. The marketplace should provide a collection / favorites feature.

This is a problem becuase it breaks people's muscle memory. I personally change a theme once per day at least and for doing that I just quickly do F1 'theme' and press enter without looking and I always get the wrong option.
Could we rename the theme generator to be worse ranked?

The command list(default shortcut: Cmd+Shift+P) is now sorting by characters, I think it will be more convenience if VSCode could sorting by the frequency of use.

For example, I often expect when I enter "install", the first command of the list is "Extensions: Install Extensions", but now is "Extensions: Disable All Installed Extensions", that really weird...</Description>

summary: don't open the "find dialog" when repeating a find.  It doesn't add any value and clutters the screen

I frequently use find next/previous to quickly navigate thru my file when I need to review and/or edit portions of the code.  The find dialog box obscures a portion of my code effectively causing me to have to close it after each ```find```.  I'm unclear on the value of opening the dialog on a find next - if I wanted to start a new search, I would.

- OS Version: MacOS sierra 10.12.4
## List of installed extensions
```
EditorConfig.EditorConfig@0.9.3
HookyQR.beautify@1.0.2
christian-kohler.path-intellisense@1.4.2
dbaeumer.vscode-eslint@1.2.8
dracula-theme.theme-dracula@1.17.0
eg2.tslint@0.15.0
mitchdenny.ecdc@0.10.3
msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome@3.1.1
naumovs.theme-oceanicnext@0.0.4
robertohuertasm.vscode-icons@7.7.0
```
## Steps to Reproduce:
### Expected
```scss
//type and hit tab.
df --&gt; display: flex;
posa --&gt; position: absolute;
```

### Actual
```scss
//type and hit tab
df --&gt; stroke-dashoffset: 
posa --&gt; padding-block-start: 
```

The funny thing is, if I hit undo and hit tab again, they give me the desired result. So
```scss
df --&gt; stroke-dashoffset: **UNDO** df --&gt; display: flex;
```

**NOTE:** The problem exists in the insiders build, 1.13.0 too with ZERO extensions installed. </Description>

    <Title>"Find All References" throws error</Title>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Hover over a function name (optionally select / highlight function name).
2. Right-click and select "Find All References"

produces error included below.  Happens most times, but not _every_ time, and I've not been able to figure out any pattern.  When it does happen, the interface incorrectly reports no matches - which is not ideal.

The terminal automatically allows you to hold down cmd (on mac) and click on a string that appears to be a URL. The parser seems to be overly strict as to what constitutes a URL. In this case, it looks to see if there are at least two periods in the domain name. This is often not the case, as debug output could have URLs such as:

http://internal_server/some_path

(Interestingly enough, http://localhost/some_path does highlight so it seems that this one-word domain is special-cased by the parser.)

---

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open a terminal window inside of VSCode
2. Type the following (without quotes):
`echo http://a.b.c/path` and press ENTER
3. Hold down CMD (on mac, presumably CTRL on Windows) and hover your mouse over the URL. The URL will become clickable.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for the following URLs:
`http://a.b/path` (Not clickable)
`http://a/path` (Not clickable)
`http://localhost/path` (Clickable)
`http://internal_server/some_path` (Not clickable)
`http://a:8000/path` (Not clickable)

**Expected:** All the links above should be clickable.</Description>

    <Title>How to set environment variables before running integrated terminal?</Title>
    <Description>My current integrated shell terminal on Windows 10 is a batch file this these contents:

```bat
@echo off

set CHERE_INVOKING=1

C:\Cygwin64\bin\zsh.exe --login --interactive
```

This allows me to start Cygwin's Zsh at the current opened folder path. But this will make it so that the integrated terminal is "wrapped" around a batch script, which has a few issues. For instance, trying to press `Ctrl+D` to terminate the shell, sometimes I get `Terminate batch job (Y/N)?` and it's annoying.

How can I set `CHERE_INVOKING=1` and call `zsh.exe` directly (with `--login` and `--interactive` arguments) with that environment variable set? Is there anyway to do this within VS Code without a batch file?</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open .cs file containing a C# class
2. Notice other features of the extension are functioning: Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, .NET Core Attach debugging, etc.
3. The extension is installed (see list above) in ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.9.0/
4. The snippets file exists in the snippets sub-dir as csharp.json
5. Common snippets like "prop", "namespace", etc. simply do not appear.
6. Note the "class" snippet does show up in the intellisense list but produces bad output:
```
    class Name
    {
    
    ,
    }|&lt;== the cursor is left here after specifying the class name and hitting return
```
7. "foreach" snippet does the same thing:
```
            foreach (var item in collection)
            {
            
            ,
            }|&lt;== the cursor is left here after specifying var, item and collection and hitting return
```
8. Command-Shift-p and "Insert Snippet" shows the snippets that will show up in context; all of the ones I tried from the list had the same formatting issues.
9. Here is what I see from csharp.json for the "class" snippet.
```
        "Class": {

                "prefix": "class",
                "body": [
                        "class ${Name}",
                        "{",
                        "       $0",
                        "}"
                ],
                "description": "Class"
        },
```
Given this I suspect there are some syntax errors in this file. But see below - it appears that is not the whole story.

_Note I did try to re-compile the extension in hopes that the json file would be regenerated somehow. But after npm i and doing npm run compile I got an error about missing tsconfig.json file and then also noticed there was no source delivered with the extension. So I stopped there._

Note the csharp.json file had not changed since Oct 2016 - there were 2 commits recently:
[csharp.json commmits](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/commits/master/snippets/csharp.json)

There are several issues opened in the OmniSharp repo - [#1459](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1459) is just one. So treat this as an FYI.

However they do reference [MS VSCode #26101](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26101) as part of the problem.

The [OmniSharp VSCode #1464](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1464) issue was closed on May 8 by Dustin Campbell with a reference to MS #26101.

I am hoping you and the OmniSharp folks can fix this soon. It is impactful to snippets across all extensions.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a tab rendering rather heavy WebGL, keep it as the focused tab
2. Go to VSCode, try to edit (scroll around, type) a file

I'm not sure if this is a bug, as I'm not sure why Chrome's performance should affect VSCode's. I'm using the latest version, but I noticed this as well on older versions.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.1
- OS Version: Win7 x64

Basically it looks like it decreases the height of the window so it won't cover the taskbar. Taskbar doesn't extend to the second monitor so you end up having to resize the window to fit the screen height every time you re-open.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open vscode
2. Move to second monitor
3. Increase window height so that it fills the entire height of the second monitor
4. Close and re-open vscode

    <Title>Node2 not respecting startFrame</Title>
    <Description>Node2 seems not to be respecting [`startFrame`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/common/debugProtocol.d.ts#L622)

To be more precise if vscode sends to node2 a `stackTrace` request with `startFrame: 2` and `levels: 20` I still get back the first stack frame.
I can easily reproduce this with a simple javascript sample that does not have a deep call stack - only around 10 stack frames.

This milestone we are looking into a performance improvement to always first fetch the first callStack and in parallel fetch the rest (while the editor is already updated). Due to this I am assigning this issue to the May milestone. More details about the perf imrovement https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25605

I will probably push to insiders these call stack improvements to get coverage for other debug adapters and figure out who is not respecting it (first call stack will be shown duplicated). Also then you will be able to easily repro this.</Description>

When pressing F2 to rename a variable, VSCode always lets you enter the new name, only afterwards it appears to check whether the rename is possible and if not, it shows "You cannot rename this element".

It would be better to check this first, before even prompting for a new name, to avoid frustration that what was just written has been lost and has to be written again after using Ctrl+D or similar.</Description>

In my experience, IDE's tend to just close out the auto-completion box in this scenario. It seems quite unusual to have it input a newline in this situation.

    <Title>Multiline Snippets are non-functional</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version:  **1.12.1**
- OS Version:  **Windows 10 v1607 build 14393.1066**

Until just recently (last update?), multiline snippets were useable, but now that appears to not be the case.  Here is an example of a broken snippet that previously worked:

```
     "Author Comment": {
		"prefix": "Author",
		"body": [
			"&lt;#",
			"	Author:		${Author:Matthew A. Pearon}",
			"	Date:		${Date:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}",
			"	Keywords:	${Keywords:Keywords}",
			"	Parameters:	${Parameters:Parameters}",
			"#&gt;"
		],
		"description": "Insert Author Comment Block"
	}
```

When used, it now just return this:
```
&lt;#

,

```

I will be able to attach a gif to this post later.</Description>

2. All I can find is the overall "editor.foreground" but I like the color of that, but I'd rather use a lighter gray or white for the text in the active menu item.  I can (and did) theme the _background_ but there doesn't seem to be a corresponding foreground.</Description>

    <Title>Running foundation CLI in the integrated terminal</Title>
    <Description>I am getting a strange behavior when running 'foundation watch' and then 'foundation build' using the integrated terminal and foundation-cli. After running 'foundation watch' and then hitting Ctrl + C to quit the watch task, I then try to run 'foundation build' but instead of running that task, it keeps asking me 'Terminate batch job (y/n)?' The only way I can get it to work is if I quit VS code and restart it.

2. Then stop the watch task by hitting Ctrl + C and hitting Y.
3. Try to run 'foundation build'. It then keeps asking 'Terminate batch job (y/n)?' instead of running the build task.

3. Try to copy the output to paste somewhere (bug report, email)

Result:

* Drag selecting will not push scroll.
* Scrolling will deselect selection.

My work around is to use an external terminal, or to maximise the terminal, copy a section, paste, scroll, copy a section, paste and so on.</Description>

    <Title>regression: caret is rendered in wrong position when editor zoomed</Title>
    <Description>this is a regression. this did not happen in 11.1

- VSCode Version: 12.1
- OS Version: XUbuntu 16.04.2 LTS (lxde) 

Steps to Reproduce:
 - full-screen VS code
 - View-&gt;Reset Zoom
 - create a new file
 - type 100 characters on a single line (not enough to make it wrap)
 - move the caret to end of line
 - View-&gt;Zoom Out
 - type some more characters

NOTE: the caret is no longer rendered at the end of the line, and the new characters, while they appear at the end of the line, do not appear where the caret is.

 - View-&gt;Reset Zoom
 - View-&gt;Zoom In (5 times)

NOTE: different zoom levels affects the positioning error in different ways. zooming out tends to make the caret jump left &amp; right more and more. zooming in yields a subtler error, but still makes it impossible to use as a text editor.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. have a multi-line Text open in Editor. Use wrap mode. Cursor somewhere 1/3rd from left.
2. Add/remove a few characters.
3. Zoom In (enlarge / `ctrl-+`). Type a letter.

RESULT: Actual inserting is 10-15px further left, than the seeming cursor position: Here I typed three 'A' and didn't move the cursor after that... yet, the cursor seems 1¼ chars further right...

EXPECTED: correct Cursor position.

* Closing and reopening file doesn't heal.
* Effect ist stronger closer to the right side of the panel.
* I only noticed this bug in the last 1-3 releases, not before. (And I zoom quite a bit :)

I cant reproduce the bug so this is probably unhelpful, but here's how it happened:

1. Pressed ctrl + to zoom &amp; got a message VS needs to restart to apply settings. 
2. Clicked cancel (was on a roll).
3. VS reset to default everything on clicking cancel.
4. Closed VS &amp; reopened but the settings where still the default.
5. Checked .config settings json and it was certainly wiped.

Currently there is no setting for adjusting inactive editor tab as after 1.12 version update it fades and it's almost impossible to read in comparison with active editor group tabs.
It would be better if active editor would have an outline/border to highlight it's activity status. In that case inactive editors could be left untouched by fading to show their status.</Description>

1. With the MacOS version of vscode, open the menu item "Code" and select "About Visual Studio Code" 
2. Try to close the window using ⌘W, you can't.</Description>

    <Title>Go to implementation should navigate to .js file instead of typescript type definitions</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12.1
- OS Version: OS X

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code in a new workspace
2. `npm init -y`
3. `npm install --save express`
4. `npm install --save-dev @types/express`
5. In `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "allowJs": true,
        "checkJs": true,
        "noEmit": true,
        "maxNodeModuleJsDepth": 1
    },
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules"
    ]
}
```
6. In `index.js`: 
```js
const express = require('express')
```

7. Right click on `'express'`, and choose *Go to implementation*

### Expected behaviour: 

The editor navigates to the .js file containing the module implementation (under node_modules/express)

### Actual behaviour: 

The editor navigates to the installed **express** type definitions  </Description>

    <Title>Irrelevant snippet has precedence over user snippet?</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version:  1.12.1
- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.12.4

I have a snippet called `clog`, which is an abbreviation for `console.log` that I've used for quite a while. Since the last version of vs code, however. It seems that the ranking for snippets has changed, and I'm getting an irrelevant suggestion as the first choice, and muscle memory makes me want to just press return to activate it.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/577144/25853592/44a3161a-34c5-11e7-9abf-b26c2448c68a.png)

I'm not sure where this suggestion comes from, it's nothing that I've typed in any of the files I have open. But I think that probably, user snippets should get precedence here. especially if they're this specific (I'm typing the exact and complete prefix).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a javascript file
2. Create a snippet with the prefix "clog",
3. Somewhere in the file, type the word "clog" and see the suggestions appear
3. See alternative suggestions appear before manually added snippet</Description>

I think that the parser should search words backward after detecting a file path in debug console, so that it doesn't ignore the front part of relative paths. Currently the parser seems to only look forward when searching using regular expressions.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a project with a complex folder/file structure, at least big enough to fill the files treeview.
2. Select a file of a subfolder.
3. Press the "New File" icon.
4. Instead of wrtting the file's name, scroll up or down until the new file is outside the boundaries of the control.

After doing this, the "New File" command is cancelled and the tree displays files inside incorrect folders until the application is restarted.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create an extension with a snippet `do`
2. The extension should also supply different autocompletes containing the letters `d` and `o` (eg. `defoverridable`)
3. When typing `do` in a document, the first autocomplete item should (and used to) be the exact match (snippet `do`) instead the keyword autocomplete is the first item:

    <Title>Command palette: allow matching in any-word order</Title>
    <Description>Hello,

Currently when I pressing `Cmd + Shift + P` and trying to find something - it search strings in the order that I have typed. For example, I type "Project open" and expect that it will find "Open Project". But it can't find it.

It will be amazing if you will implement the same ideology of search as it is in the Sublime Text. They allow to search words in any order, and even search strings by first letters or part of the word.

Example of the **Command Palette** in the SublimeText:
![687474703a2f2f616e67756c61722d75692e6769746875622e696f2f416e67756c61724a532d7375626c696d652d7061636b6167652f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f742d717569636b5f70616e656c2d7365617263682e706e67](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/630224/25847091/edc40378-34b4-11e7-9261-d4c4df2c499b.png)

I'd like to add more information for that issue
- It's latest Windows 10 and VSCode.
- System in Chinese (Simplified)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. press ctrl+\`
2. it occurs: text in terminal with wrong indentation. (you can see image in issue #26256)

Hope that my information can help you to fix it.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Right before the update to 1.12.1, in a standard .js file, I tried to generate JSDoc with "/**" + [Enter] above a function, and all of the @param elements were pre-created.
2. I updated to 1.12.1, and doing the exact same thing ("/**" + [Enter] above a function) results in just the bare JSDoc comment structure with no @param or any other elements auto-created.

BEFORE 1.12.1 Update:
/** + [Enter] did this:
```
/**
 * @param p1
 * @param p2
 */
function( p1, p2 ) { }
```

AFTER 1.12.1 Update:
/** + [Enter] does this:
```
/**
 * 
 */
function( p1, p2 ) { }

    <Description>Hello, this is a feature request. When performing a search and replace over multiple files, I would like the ability to (optionally) do case insensitive matches, but where the replacement maintains the case of the original text match. For example, if I want to search for "FooBar" and replace with "ConcreteObject", it would replace "fooBar" with "concreteObject" and "FooBar" with "ConcreteObject". This is useful because it helps with renaming both type declarations and local variable names.</Description>

      "to_build": "LegionStructureBasicTeleporter",
      "instance_count": 1,
      "priority": 1,

        "AnyLegionFabberBasic",
        "AnyLegionFabberAdvanced",
        "LegionOrbitalBasicFabber"
      ],

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Switch to Search
2. Expand Search to include replace field
3. Enable regular expression
4. In FIND box enter: ,\n      "builders":
5. In REPLACE box enter: ,\n      "base_sort": "FromBuilder",\n      "builders":

EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:

File will become as follows:

      "name": "Legion - Bronze - Teleporter",
      "to_build": "LegionStructureBasicTeleporter",
      "instance_count": 1,
      "priority": 1,
      "max_num_assisters": 10,
      "base_sort": "FromBuilder",
      "builders": [
        "LegionCommander",
        "AnyLegionFabberBasic",
        "AnyLegionFabberAdvanced",
        "LegionOrbitalBasicFabber"
      ],

CURRENT BEHAVIOUR:

File becomes the following:

      "name": "Legion - Bronze - Teleporter",
      "to_build": "LegionStructureBasicTeleporter",
      "instance_count": 1,
      "priority": 1,
      "max_num_as
      "base_sort": "FromBuilder",
      "builders":
      "builders": [
        "LegionCommander",
        "AnyLegionFabberBasic",
        "AnyLegionFabberAdvanced",
        "LegionOrbitalBasicFabber"
      ],

NOTE: use CTRL-H search &amp; replace within a file behaves according to expected behaviour.

    <Title>Tabulations in makes snipets interpreter</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.12
- OS Version: Ubuntu 17.04
- Extensions: Some are enabled in the example, but the bug is still here with them disabled
- DevTools: Nothing interesting.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a snipet (I use PHP in this example)
2. Include tabs in it. You already see the error "Excepted comma or closing bracket"
3. Try using it. It will isue some [object Object] for absolutly no reason

![Screen Capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16436883/25802015/b9c44d4a-33f0-11e7-9f44-6a1730869c4c.png)

In this example, I use the "Function description" snipet.

Edit: Partial fix to use tabs in snipets: using \t instead of a tab directly

- VSCode Version: 1.12.1
- OS Version: Linux Mint 18.1 Serena (based on Ubuntu 16.04.4)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Hold Ctrl and press Tab to display list of recent files and select the last open file
2. Release the Tab key

Expected behavior:

The file list closes, and the editor switches to the selected file in the list, which is the previously open file.

Actual behavior:

The list remains open. Editor does not close the list until and open the selected file until the Enter key is pressed.

Notes:

I've tested this with the same version of Code on both Linux and Windows, and the incorrect behavior only seems to occur under Linux.

    <Description>Time and time again, I get errors because I have unwittingly moved a file with my mouse.
There is a dialog box asking for confirmation of a file delete.
Would it be too much to ask to have a a similar box when moving a file.
If it is considered that most people consider the benefit is outweighed by the extra click required,
perhaps there could be a Preference setting.
Thank you.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.create a new JavaScript file named: service.js
2.write code: "import React from 're'"

What I want to say is why the import not auto completed after the VS code has been upgraded?

I mean when I am typing the "import React from 're'", it should prompt me like "import React from 'react'".

It works good before I upgrade to the latest version.</Description>

I'm trying to work with the new theming colors; however, it seems that the dimming of the inactive tab in an inactive group is greater than before?

I can't seem to find a combination that is readable unless I make the inactive tab color `#FFFFFF` which then makes it way too bright when the group is active.</Description>

Hello, first of all, I want to thank everyone for this awesome text editor.

Since the last update, my terminal seems to have a really weird formatting when running gulp tasks.
Here's a screenshot illustrating this issue: https://snag.gy/tdx2u4.jpg
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open new terminal 
2. Run a gulp task that has a big output length</Description>

    <Title>Setting custom terminal shell for a workspace doesn't work in more than one workspace</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.12.1
- OS Version: Mac OS 10.12.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In ".vscode/settings.json", set a custom workspace terminal shell. For example, to enable zsh on Max OS:
`
{
  "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh"
}
`
A bar appears on top of VSC and asks if you want to allow the workspace to manage the terminal shell. Click "Allow".
It works: the shell used in the terminal is the one that was defined

2. Try to do it again in another workspace, or in a third one. It doesn't work: the terminal remains the default terminal.

Can anyone else reproduce it?</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. I usually use Snippet such as Javascript code snippets, Jquery code snippets  and my snippets.
But after updating, everything is changed. You can see below image.

&gt; ( I want to select basically 'console.log()' when I typed 'clg', not 'ConstrainLong' and my snippet's priorty became the lowest. It's very sad and annoying. )

2. I really hate, this VS code version. UI font is larger than before and my previous configure was ignored.  but I didn't get any advantage something. I WANNA GO PREVIOUS VERSION. This version is really suck!

How can I? Plz, plz tell me rapidly! Thank you!</Description>

I have configured the following in keybindings.json

```
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+a",
        "command": "workbench.action.toggleActivityBarVisibility",
        "when": "inZenMode"
    }
```

The expectation is to be able to use the shortcut when in ZenMode to toggle the activity bar.
But the shortcut is only active **outside** ZenMode!

Also, with each toggle, the icons for VSTS (work items, pull requests etc). get duplicated within the status bar!

    <Description>If I want to write same code in several place  , I will use alt+click to generate multiple cursor . But when I press 'tab' to use autocomplete , it can't works.

And if I generate a cursor in a wrong place，I don't know how to remove it , I can only come back again .

I read the Official documents [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor](url) , but I just find how to make multiple cursor.

    <Title>release notes are NOT searchable</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.12


- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open release notes
2. search for string (Cmd-F) such as  work.
3. Scream

The release notes seem to be some of bizarre presentation format, which I am sure is obvious to VS Code developer/documenter, but while it is presented in a document window, it's a truly royal pain to navigate as document.  The particular of this bug is that's not searchable, but more generally, THINGS IN DOCUMENT WINDOWS SHOULD ACT LIKE DOCUMENTS. 

If the document is REALLY a web page, OPEN A WEB BROWSER (https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_12) for the user so they have an suitable experience (which btw, supports searching).  At minimum, the top of the document should state:
* it's not normal document (state what it **is**)
* Include a link to the web version of the document

Somehow, for some files I get capitalized duplicates:

Both entries open the same file (there's only one file `printable.ml`). For the capitalized entry, the tab-title is also capitalized, but it highlights the correct (lowercase) file in the explorer.
The strange thing is that this only happens for some files (in this folder only for the last three files, not the rest).</Description>

Hi.
I've just noticed that there is an autosave of files that are not saved. It's great ! But there is something that i miss : an autosave for the language selected ! If you create a file, and write down some code, you'll most likely change the plain text to Java, C++ or whatever you want. Iif you restart VSCode, your file will still be there, but not the selected language !

    <Title>Neo keyboard 4'th layer backspace not working</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - OSS 1.11.2 (6eaebe3b9c70406d67c97779468c324a7a95db0e, 2017-05-02T20:44:27.820Z)
- OS Version: Linux x64 4.10.11-1-ARCH
- Extensions: none
---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. use neo layout:
    $ setxkbmap de neo
2. Fresh install vscode:
    $ yaourt visual-studio-code-oss      //-git or the binary have the same problem
3. start vscode, open an new text file and type some text
4. press "ALT-GR + v" or "&lt; + v" (should be backspace on 4'th layer) --&gt; not working

- the normal backspace works.
- the arrow keys, DEL, ENTER and the other keys on the 4'th layer work as fine as everytime
- note: in the search dialog for the keyboard-shortcut-config, the 4'th layer backspace works
- I tried to delete all key-configs for keys related to "v" or "backspace" which changed nothing

    <Title>Enhancement - search project dir by filename</Title>
    <Description>currently if I open a dir with large # of files, I dont see a way to search for a file, I can only search inside open files, 

lets say I want to find file named file68, i have to scroll all the way down, In this example its easy because of numerical naming, but in real examples I spend lot of time scrolling through hundreds of files to find the right file to edit, should be an easier way.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a JS file
2. Dialog appears: "Could not install typings files for JavaScript language features. Please ensure that NPM is installed and is in your PATH"

I do have NPM installed, but we install node with NVM (Node Version Manager), which has confused some other plugins (mostly in Sublime Text) that expect a conventional install of Node.

My bash_profile:
````
# source ~/.profile
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
#PS1="\u$ "
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:node_modules/.bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"
# export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules

export CLICOLOR=1
# export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced

    <Title>Strange boxes</Title>
    <Description>Hi VS Code team. I love the app and use it a bunch, thank you! 

I have one problem though. These (what I can only call) strange boxes often appear on the editor no matter what theme I am using. The frustrating thing is that these boxes often move and blink whilst I'm typing. 

Is this an VS Code problem or something else?

 What do you think the problem could be? I've attached pictures to help explain.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.10.1 and previous, 
- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview, x64

I installed VS Code in a custom path, `C:\Office`. When I update the program the new version of VS Code is installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code`.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install VS Code in `C:\Office`.
2. Update VS Code when it ask me to update it to a newer version.
3. The updater will install the program in a default path, `C:\Program Files (x86)`, while it does not ask me anything about the installation path.
4. Now I have two VS Code installed in the system, the one is in `C:\Office\Microsoft VS Code` and the other is in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code`. 
5. When I open `C:\Office\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe` it will ask me to update the program again because the program remains in the same version.

When there is nothing matched yet, snippets should have a default lower ranking then actual properties. Often I use intellisense to discover properties on an object, now I have to scroll down past all my snippets. I don't want to set `"editor.snippetSuggestions": "bottom"` because I still want them to match when I do start typing.

However when I try to run VS Code, it loads for some time trying to open, but then nothing happens, no errors, nothing.
I have tried to installed both trough rpm package and zipped files, but got the same result in both cases.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.11.2 (1.11.2)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open an instance of code from the command line `code .`
2. open a second instance of code for the same directory using the `--new-window` flag (`code --new-window .`

I seem to get the same window again. These flags are documented [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)

I get this same behaviour when debugging an extension locally

    <Title>A rendering bug when typing Arabic after an English word</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Latest and greatest (Both stable:  1.11.2 / Insiders: 1.12.0-insider)
- OS Version: mac sierra

Today I found a very interesting bug. Which is not something that should normally be bothering anyone but maybe it's better to be fixed. I was unaware that my keyboard layout was Persian and I typed:
```
ُ
```
After the `constructor` and look what happens when you actually do that:

![arabic-vaj-probelm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/25494561/3843bbc0-2b8f-11e7-978e-2fd550fae292.gif)

So I guess you can use this to reproduce the bug

```
            constructorٍ ( ) {

            }
```

I believe the problem is with [`U+0610` to `U+061A`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script_in_Unicode).

As always thanks you so much for the Code, It's the best goddamn editor ever existed and really changed my workflow to something that every time I run it I feel so grateful.
Wishing you an awesome awesome time.</Description>

    <Title>Suggestion: render whitespace: show new line characters</Title>
    <Description>I have `editor.renderWhitespace` set to `all`, but it does not show me new line characters.

This would be useful, as when I have word wrapping enabled, it's not clear whether the line breaks because of a new line character or because of VSCode's word wrapping feature.</Description>

Node 6.5.0

- OS Version: 10.0.14393

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the Integrated terminal
2. Run a command with a longer enough output to cause part of the output to not be visible (you'll have scroll bars)
3. Scroll to the beginning of your output, select 1-2 lines
4. Scroll to the bottom of the output
5. SHIFT+Click to select all output
6. Right-click to copy the output to your clipboard
7. Paste your clipboard content somewhere else
8. In my tests with Code and Insiders, only the visible part of the output is copied: one would assume the "hidden" output is still selected and therefore copied to the clipboard but that does not seem to be the case

    <Title>Settings editor gets emptied</Title>
    <Description>Since a couple of days (actually might be weeks) I often see the right hand side of the settings editor turn completely empty. This typically happens when switching between tabs and then later coming back to the editor:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/25425821/757cc39c-2a6d-11e7-9939-7aa01e54bf82.png)

in this case what I did was:
* change some settings
* open a file to the side
* click on another tab (settings got hidden)
* start a search
* click back to settings

Not sure yet how to reproduce better though.</Description>

    <Description>[Feature request]
- VSCode Version: 1.11.2
- OS Version: Win 10 - Version: 10.0.14393 Build 14393

MRU (most recently used) (or say most used command) feature is missing in command palette of VS Code. This feature is present in Sublime Text and helps one to type same set of keys to focus on the most used command with those keystrokes rather than using arrow keys to reach to that needed command.

Another request which **directly relates** to this is that the previously typed text should hold in Command Palette just like in Sublime so one can access the previous command .

It would be very helpful to render the newline characters, with distinct renderings for CR vs LF. This is especially helpful if you have a mixed line ending file and want to see where the issues are.

    <Title>Cycle trough previous searches in 'Go to File' input</Title>
    <Description>Recently switched to vscode from Atom and the only thing I miss very much is to easily cycle through previous queries when searching for a specific file using  `Ctrl + P` (or `Ctrl + E`)
Search history is [already implemented](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5508#issuecomment-246646872) for Search box and Find box. That would be cool to implement something similar also for `Go to File` box</Description>

    <Title>Timing problem in the terminal</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: master
- OS: Windows

The terminal seems to have timing problems under Windows in terms of detecting and firing the exit event. I sometime see the following output:

Press any key to close the terminal
HelloWorld.ts(3,17): error TS2339: Property 'loog' does not exist on type 'Console'.

The problem here is that the terminal fires the exit event before it print `Press any key to close the terminal`. The task running framework stops parsing the output when the exit event is fired hence `HelloWorld.ts(3,17): error TS2339: Property 'loog' does not exist on type 'Console'.` is not recognized as being a valid output of the task anymore.

IMO the terminal should fire 'exit' or some other event when all output from the process is processed. I remember that in the output runner framework I was listening to close events on stdio as well to make sure I processed all output correctly.

    <Title>Multicursor highlighting on selection behaves oddly</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.9.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type the text `XXXXXX`
2. Select the first `X`
3. Hit cmd-D multiple times. The selection will grow exponentially:

I expected each cmd-D keypress to select the next X.

Furthermore, the "highlight all" behaves similarly oddly: It will highlight _pairs_ of whatever you selected:

![t2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/23344473/096e8032-fc4b-11e6-93ee-3c7e1f90d68f.gif)

Even weirder, if you replace the text, then undo, any adjacent selections are collapsed (so it doesn't undo the selection properly):

![t3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/23351704/b173a006-fc90-11e6-9059-0d10959523d3.gif)

1. Type 20 Zs.
2. Select one Z and "highlight all". There are now 10 selections of 2 characters each (wrong).
3. Type "p" to replacing all of them. You get 10 p's (wrong).
4. Undo. There are now 5 selections of 4 characters each (wrong).
5. Type "p" to replace all of them again. You get 5 p's (wrong).

    <Title>Problem with unreadable texts in tabs due to low contrast, brightness</Title>
    <Description>Most themes (and I think it's not their fault) use in effect very unreadable colors with low brightness/contrast ratios for inactive tabs, since they are faded using opacity. This is very inconvenient - not being able to clearly see what files are open and finding easily the ones I want. Especially if you are working at night with decreased screen brightness or in bright light (in the morning).

Currently:

I am not proposing a solution, as I feel it may come from multiple directions e.g..:
- allow themes to customize tabs styling
- do not use opacity to fade inactive tab, highlight active tab by other means
- allows custom user styling of tabs...</Description>

    <Title>30 seconds of 100% CPU usage every time my web app makes an ajax request</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Arch Linux (kernel v4.8.8)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Trigger any HTTP request when running the web application I'm working on (sorry, it isn't open source, so I realize that doesn't help a great deal)

The problem is that when I do this, vscode immediately jumps to 100% CPU on one core, and stays there for about 30 seconds before returning to normal. Naturally, this cuts the battery life of my laptop pretty dramatically, to the extent that I am not willing to make vscode my primary editor.
![vscode using 100 cpu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3988775/21951406/c1379aae-d9d3-11e6-8ac5-8767c9fe7a74.png)

Oddly, it is a `code` process that spikes, but performance while using the application does not seem to be affected. At first I thought it might be reindexing files (due to adding a rendered view file or some such), but I tried adding and editing test files, and neither produced the same result (doesn't rule it out, just makes it less a likely suspect in my mind). I have also tried opening it via `code --disable-extensions`, and I still have the same issue, so it's not an extension that's causing the problem.

Here are a few details about my project that might help narrow it down:
- this is a large application (hundreds of thousands of files)
- we use PHP (Laravel) for the back-end, and we're in the process of transitioning to Angular 2 in TypeScript (from an awkward mish-mash of Angular 1, Knockout, and some other stuff that we wrote ourselves in CoffeeScript)
- we use gulp, webpack, npm, and websockets (to name a few more technologies that might be relevant)

To make this even more of a challenge, none of my three coworkers who are using vscode for this project are experiencing this issue, despite having very similar setups. At this point I don't have much hope of there being a clear solution, but I wanted to log this so that if anyone else experiences it, they may be able to add more info that would help diagnose it.</Description>

    <Description>When doing a replace (in current file) and there is a selection that spans lines, the "find in selection" ought to be enabled by default.

1.  I believe this is standard behavior in most other programmer's editors (visual studio, intellij, textpad++)
2.  Ignoring the current context (multiple line selection) when doing a search makes no sense - why else would the use have made the selection then pressed replace?
3. For me at least, its pretty rare that I want to do a global search/replace.  This is certainly the least likely use case</Description>

Currently when we have the cursor near a ( ] } etc, the matching brace color is extremely faint, and difficult to spot in the middle of the code.

A stronger and contrasting background color ( as it happens on the Brackets editor) would help tremendously.

it would be nice that it can also execute an in-memory diff (with of course an upper limit on the size of file specified in the config) between the last saved copy and the actual one in the editor to understand if the two copies are really different, leaving the undo/redo history.

Is there a way of doing this?  

In Sublime and Atom, IIRC, it is the same shortcut for adding the cursors and to remove a cursor if you click on one of them.  
Following the same logic, vscode should remove the cursor with Alt+click, but I also tried various other combinations and nothing has worked.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with an empty text file

3. Paste in some text, where the _end_ of the text matches the search in step 1 (eg. `Trevor Sullivan`)
4. Hit `CTRL + H` to perform another search / replace
5. The regex search you performed is replaced with the word directly preceding the matching text

Let me know if you need help reproducing this behavior. I was able to do it myself several times.

    <Title>Empty workspace: keep UI state and reopen files</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10 Version: 1607

**Scenario:** Open files from different directories (not using the "open folder" function) by either dragging them into the editor or using Open File. Close VSC, reopen it.
**Desired Behaviour:** All previously opened files are reopened with the same view/caret position.
**Actual Behaviour:** VSC is blank when opened

I know this feature exists for "Open Folder" but that's not what I want as I rarely open files this way, normally the files span completely different directories (or even machines).

Discussed further in this thread #101 (but a separate issue).

    <Title>Touchpad scrolling doesn't work</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10
- Laptop: Asus n56-vz, I'm using Asus Smart Gesture drivers for touchpad.

Suddenly touchpad scrolling stopped working.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Add a lot of code yo see a scroll bar.
2) Try to scroll with 2-finger gesture - doesn't work;

Not sure about the reason of this behavior.
I've been using VSCode for several hours, than I turned my laptop into a sleep mode.
After waking it up back, VSCode no more responses on a touchpad scrolling (with 2 fingers).

I tried to reboot the system, no effect.
I also tried to reinstall VSCode, but it seems like I haven't achieved complete removing (cause, for example, all my extensions were safe), so it didn't help too.

Have anyone also faced with such an issue or maybe there are some tips to do in order to solve this problem?

Observe that the term is hidden by the find-box, the window is not scrolled far enough to the right to show it

E.g. in this image I have searched for "mp3", you can see the start of the path in "Value" but the actual "mp3" itself is hidden because this is the first line in the file.

    <Title>Highlight is persistent after deleting a code block</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3
- OS Version: Mac OS

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Highlight a block of code for deletion
2. Delete the code block
3. The highlight is persistent and now highlights some lines of code that replaces the deleted code block
4. This leads to unintentional deletion of newly highlighted line (say, if you press 'backspace' twice when trying to delete some whitespace before the initially highlighted code block)

    <Title>Can't select adjacent strings as multiple selection</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.1
- OS Version: Windows 8/10

In multiple selection, when two or more selections adjoin, those are combined to single selection. Or, can't select those.

Case 1: With `foo foofoo bar foo bar`, I want to do something to `foo`.
![01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4763469/16299439/40354f90-3975-11e6-89da-d4c40c419469.gif)
1. I selected first `foo`.
2. I pressed `Ctrl+D` three times.
3. Then, It seems that four `foo`s were selected.
4. I pressed `x` key.

I expected `x xx bar x bar`, but result was `x x bar x bar`.
`foofoo` was selected as single selection.

Case 2: With `foofoo bar foo bar`, I want to do something to `foo`.
![02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4763469/16299444/487f21b2-3975-11e6-9511-e62cb217341f.gif)
1. I selected first `foo`.
2. I pressed `Ctrl+D`.
3. Then, only `foofoo` was selected, and another `foo` was not selected.

A string in "Find" text box was changed to `foofoo` when second `foo` was selected.

Case 3: I tried to select `foo` and `foo` as two selection by using mouse with `Alt` key.
![03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4763469/16299447/4ee3d0e8-3975-11e6-9dc8-ed3e2bc0628c.gif)

Those became single selection when those became adjacent strings.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a code block
2. Hit backspace fast after completing the selection.

Result:

VSCode goes ahead and carries over the selection to whatever is occupying the same space now. If you wait a little after selection, the problem does not happen.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11 (commit: f291f4) downloaded today
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 x64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the editor, hit `CTRL-H` for Find &amp; Replace pop-up

Screen grab of the issue:

![test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2192439/13959231/056f47e4-f019-11e5-8b8f-91bd982e0870.gif)

Issue: Notice the **Find** field should be focused first when the dialog is opened. Instead, the **Replace** field is focused. And `tab` moves the focus forward, to the little icons (one would have to know to `shift-tab` to get back to Find.)

**ETA:** Ah, I suppose this changed at some point, I was comparing 0.10.11 Linux to 0.10.3 Windows.

So it becomes a question of which implementation is "more better". :p :)

Alright, well, here's a list of editor software that focuses the Find input when pressing `Ctrl-H`:
- Microsoft Office
- Google Docs
- GitHub in-browser editor
- Sublime
- Visual Studio 2015 (community / windows)
- Atom 1.5.3

Vs. editors that focus Replace first:
- Atom 1.0.2

Feel free to bring others to my attention.

    <Description>_From @Franziskus1988 on March 3, 2016 14:6_

Sometimes it's difficult to find/see the green marked linting errors. Especially when a file contains a lot of comments (normally green).

Would it be possible to make the color and maybe the line thickness configurable?

Imagine I have the cursor at teh end of this line of code

vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.languageId

When I press ctrl + left arrow, I hear 'languageId' being announced. I then press ctrl + left arrow again. The cursor moves to before the '.' and I head 'document' being announced (although the cursor  is positioned after the document token). I press ctrl + left-arrow once more. The cursor is now positioned before the document token but I hear 'document' being announced again. It makes it sound like I have document typed twice.

    <Title>Git Extension: Choose branches and get a list of changed files</Title>
    <Description>Hi,

Today in the Git extension you get a list of files that has changed since the last commit, this is a feature that is really appreciated!

I think it would be neat if this could be extended so that the user can choose two branches and get a list of files that has changed between them. When you click on a file you get the compare window just as today.

In other words there are two drop-down lists and when 'master' and 'my_work_branch' are chosen I get a list of files that has changed between these branches. 
'my_work_branch' and 'Not Committed Files' gives a list of files exactly as today and could be the default selection of the two drop-down lists.

Perhaps the selections could be extended even more so that you can select between commits in one branch, i.e. 'my_work_branch/1' and 'my_work_branch/5' gives a list of files that has changed between these commits. 

For my own preference I believe it would be enough to just compare between the last version of each branch and files that has been changed but not committed. I try to keep changes in my work branch to a minimum and then it would be great to see ALL the changes I have done against the master branch.

With this feature it would be quite easy to compare the difference between branches and also to copy desired functionality (code) between branches through the compare window.</Description>

    <Title>Give us a silent auto-update</Title>
    <Description>While I understand that there's the argument of users seeing automatic updates break the UI or extensions, I think a counterargument could be made where "silent updates" are a configuration setting disabled by default. 

Having VSCode nag at you on a regular basis about updates, when all you're trying to do is work quickly, is really annoying. Yes, the update takes "just" a minute. Unfortunately that's alot of time while one is in the process of trying to work quickly. In addition, after seeing that nag bar, it's not uncommon for it to keep bothering one and causing thought patterns along the lines of 'is it gonna nag me again after I choose "Open this file in VS Code" in Explorer? wait, what was the file I was wanting to open again...'. 

All this would be completely prevented by automatic silent updates. I believe it's not too much to be asked to provide a way for an advanced user to say "Hi VS Code. You are at liberty to update silently in the background, and I fully accept that I may need to manually roll back or mess around at times. Something I'd have to do anyway if I choose to accept the update manually".

In addition, If there's the argument of "but if it updates when you are working, won't it take the minute anyway?" then the answer is "Obviously it shouldn't kill the instance when it's open, just update the files silently in the background".

    <Title>Expand selection doesn't always work with every theme (for quotes)</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type anything between quotes
2. Put cursor between the cursor on what you just typed and use expand selection (Alt+Shift+Right Arrow)
3. Try it first with Dark+ (default) theme or Dracula Theme and then with Mattia Astornio's Material Theme or with Nord theme

Thing to notice: If the quotes are colored as same as text, it includes it in the selection, but it doesn't if it has different color assigned. 

![ff2de466-29bb-11e7-9230-5e5ff7f0443d](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26769888/25409665/81d88366-2a30-11e7-85ee-4011b1739ddf.gif)


To-do: Expand selection should not include quotes, but just the text because a lot of times we need to change what is inside the quotes only. Putting quotes around the text again will add one step more.

Originally posted on Dracula theme repo, but as it also includes the default Dark+ theme and seems to be like a bug in VS Code itself, which I found a lot of people like and stick to it, so I put it here too.

    <Title>node_modules folder hidden if excluded from jsconfig</Title>
    <Description>Having the line `"exclude": [ "node_modules" ]` in `jsconfig.json` hid the node_modules folder from the file explorer, which I believe is not the intended behavior. I was able to restore it by adding `"files.exclude": { "**/node_modules": false }` to my User Settings file. 

When this line is subsequently removed from User Settings and re-saved, the `node_modules` folder remains in the file explorer.

- VSCode Version: 1.11.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add `jsconfig.json` containing `"exclude": [ "node_modules" ]` to a Node.js project folder. (Folder has `package.json` with dependencies that haven't been installed yet.)
2. Run `npm install` in project. `node_modules` folder is created but does not appear in VS Code file explorer.
3. Unhide `node_modules` folder by adding `"files.exclude": { "**/node_modules": false }` to User Settings file.
4. When `"files.exclude": { "**/node_modules": false }` is removed from User Settings, `node_modules` folder remains unhidden.

    <Title>Persistent result view for Find All References</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.11.2

I'm trying to explore the code in a large (~25000 LOC) TypeScript file, and it gets a little confusing when you're only able to look at the find references result for a single function at a time. I had two feature requests:

 - Would it be possible to give users the option to disable the code-attached Find References result window and simply display it as a fixed pane somewhere?
 - Would it be possible to display a history of Find References searches and their results? Something similar to Notepad++'s find results:

![Notepad++ find results](https://ldzfpw.by3302.livefilestore.com/y4mqGe8s5zgmKkAVaIZgSe7QPIdPU1Lc_G9GUWbSOxKg_Dh2LC_iYXfxI88ZyfmbrA6Ptcya2OTsTolCUn7gxFj7NS0N4cvImTr6IDf0fTfRpqwKUMXeXS9BiIcGK0PbXiWLAxnl7LQZpyISjioeU-gWBGrclX4xG_XCM2xRVWgRHpgAAqv4tLt-PDW5Z0hZda_LGCmGhOtWnNaSYljKgYUlg/2017-04-23_19-20-34.gif?psid=1)

A more general solution to the problem would be some kind of symbol explorer that lets you inspect the complete reference graph of any symbol, however this might be prohibitively expensive given how the language server protocol works.</Description>

    <Title>Lightbulb Gets in the Way of Breakpoint</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.11.2
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Try to set a breakpoint by clicking in the margin area

Expected outcome: breakpoint can easily be set
Actual outcome: lightbulb icon sitting in the margin "blocks" the breakpoint from being set

Note: I'm pretty sure the lightbulb used to "float" out in the editor area when activated, and that was fine, but at some point, it was moved into the margin area. I find this is frustrating when in the midst of an intense debugging session.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a project that has source control enabled
2. Make some changes, save them, and commit them
3. Click the circular spinner icon

Expected outcome: spinner icon animation plays when push is occurring
Actual outcome: spinner icon animation no longer plays

I think this stopped working with the April release. It's not mission critical by any means, but I miss it.

I think, that undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) keys are swapped. In my Fedora operating system the keyboard setting is HU. It is my keyboard:
1st line:       qwertzuiopőú
2nd line:      asdfghjkléáű
3rd line:       íyxcvbnm
The Z and Y keys are swapped in my keyboard because of HU settings.

2. press Ctrl+Z : nothing is happened
3. press Ctrl+Y : deleted characters are restored

```ts
export interface QuickPickItem {
  alwaysVisible?: boolean;
}

export interface QuickPickOptions {
  onDidPickItem?&lt;T extends QuickPickItem&gt;(item: T | string, input: string): any;

    <Title>Can't --inspect into a remote node container (port translation not working)</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: insider
- OS Version: Windows 10 + docker

This issue is related to the previews one, albeit this time the translation issue is with port number.
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23257

Now IP translation works as VSCode is respecting the launch.json IP.
However the same problem was not resolved for port translation.

That is, VSCode seems to ignore the port I specify in launch.json

Example [Host port -&gt; Container port]
9999 -&gt; --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0:9229
The above work when I open it in chrome as 172.17.0.1:9999 but it doesn't in VSCode if I specify the port number in launch.json as 9999 

Google Chrome handles both flawlessly.

1. Alt+Z to try to toggle word wrap
1. Select Word Wrap from command palette.
1. Source is not word wrapped.

It would be great if it had support for same layout as for vim (:sp/:vsp). Hence, splitting one window pane horizontally and at the same time have two window panes horizontally divided.

    <Title>search bug: "whole word" toggles appearance of results in non-loaded files</Title>
    <Description>Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a c++ project with some '#include' statements in some files
2. close all editor windows
3. open search panel, clear ALL search flags (case, word, regex)
4. search for "#include" (without quotes). NOTE: search results appear
5. turn ON 'Match whole word'. NOTE search results dissappear. ok...
6. open a c++ file containing the text '#include'
7. repeat the search. NOTE: the search results include the text contained in the open file.

this is inconsistent. either 'match whole word' should match '#include', or it shouldn't. but it shouldn't depend on whether or not the file is open in the editor.

    <Title>IntelliSense problems if `Flow` plugin is used</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.11.2
- OS Version: Linux Ubuntu 16.04

Hello, I opened issue here https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/issues/97 and they said it's VS Code problem, maybe anyone can take attention on that? This plugin is very good, because it improves IntelliSense and we don't need to use `.ts` files to have improved IntelliSense, but the problem is, it somehow duplicates suggestions and some of them arranges to the end or at the middle which is really bad, but still is it better to have this with improved IntelliSense. I know `Flow` and `TypeScript` not the best friends since VS Code using `TypeScript` it makes zero sense to you for trying to fix it, but it will be very cool from your side.

P.S. If someone are lazy to check issue on `Flow` plugin which is above I can post here all the content from the issue I opened.

Thank you.

    <Title>Allow Terminals To Be Opened Anywhere Files Can Be Opened.</Title>
    <Description>Feature Request:
I know this has been discussed at length, but I would like to bring up something more specific. I would like terminals to have every advantage that files have in terms of positioning and windowing. That would mean, that wherever you see a file opened in VSCode we could just as easily have a terminal there. At first, the feature request is merely about positioning of terminals, but eventually I imagine creating extensions that can register themselves as "handlers" for certain file types, and then when opening those files, the extensions can open in a terminal instead of text editor, but that would feel very integrated because those terminals are positioned and navigable just like regular files are. For example, imagine you have some binary file, and VSCode wouldn't know how to display anything but the random bits. Well, you could make an extension that handles that binary file type and opens in a terminal which opens it in some useful CLI inspector tool.

Also, I imagine that just allowing terminals to be open anywhere files are, might be a far simpler solution than some of the other proposed features for custom terminal positioning. This is a way to just avoid all the bikeshedding about some one-off behavior for terminal positioning, and my hope is that it's easier to implement since it can just reuse all the file windowing code. This way, when/if VSCode gets new window positioning features, terminals automatically benefit from it, too.

    <Title>Multi-Line Problem Matcher does not support multi-line messages</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

VS Code supports defining multi-line problem matchers, but it does not support problems with messages that span multiple lines.  Attempting to define a multi-line problem matcher for messages that span multiple lines results in VS Code defining N or N-1 problems for a single problem with N lines, where either the first line of the message is used for each of the N problems or the first line is missing and a separate problem is listed for each of the N-1 lines of the error message.

For example, given the following 3-line compiler error message:
```
myfile.cpp:6:11: error: undeclared identifier "i"
    array[i] = value;
          ^
```
There is no way to define a problem matcher that will contain all 3 lines.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. type some text (in .txt or other file with intellisense)
2. if the completionItem is not same with what I have typed, press &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; will insert the completionItem text. There is no problem and it's what we expect.
3. but if the completionItem is same with the text, press &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; will insert a new line.

I wonder if it's a new feature in recent versions. But in most cases, I don't want the new line.</Description>

As far as I can tell there isn't a way for an extension to know if there is an active debug session. This would allow an extension to alter it behavior appropriately.

Maybe something like:
`workspace.onDidChangeDebugState` with a `state` of `started | paused | stopped`

Also in addition to to the global state it would be great to be able to detect that the active editor is currently being debugged.

Maybe like:
`window.onDidChangeTextEditorDebugState` with a `state` of `started | paused | stopped`
and/or maybe a `debugState` property on the editor

For the latter case, I can give a concrete example -- in GitLens I provide a blame decoration that is applied to the end of the selected line, which works great, but when a file is being debugged it overwrites the debug decorations (variable values) which I really don't want it to do. So I'd love a way to detect that case and turn them off (ideally only if the active editor is currently being debugged -- i.e. the debug decorations would be visible). This could probably be solved by a priority on decorations or something like that (to make sure the debug ones are higher and won't be overwritten). While that might be nice to have too, having the debug events/state feels like it could be valuable to other extensions as well.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open JS file on SharePoint WebDav
2. Click ESLint error or warning
3. The file in question will duplicate into a new tab, and you will navigate to the error's line in that new tab - instead of the existing one.

Perhaps this could be a problem with ESLint, but it started happening with VSCode 1.11. ESLint didn't change during that transition.

Feel free to ping me internally (v-sthard) if you'd like a quick demo of the issue.

    <Title>Subtle error with cached(?) windows workspace/folder paths: program path uses differently cased character than file on disk</Title>
    <Description>VSCode 1.11.2
Shell 1.4.6
nodejs: 7.8.0
windows 10.0.15063

I'm debugging a nodejs app created in TypeScript.
Launch config:
```
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}\\my\\test\\test.ts",            
            "outFiles": [
                "${workspaceRoot}\\dist\\test\\**\\*.js"
            ],
```

**Error/warning messages:**

* _program path uses differently cased character than file on disk_
* _Debugging with legacy protocol because Node 7.8.0 detected_

**Consequence: Breakpoints do not get hit properly.**

First I thought ${workspaceRoot} is wrong-cased on windows but it is **not**.

After more than interesting research I found the reason (at least for my system):
* The path/folder of the project used to be "C:\\myProject"
* I changed it to "C:\\myproject"
* (The names/paths in package.json and launch config are all correct)
* After closing an re-opening VS Code serveral times, I realized that the window title said **"myProject"** instead of "myproject".
* Solution: Open any other folder in VS Code and then re-open the project folder through **"File-&gt;Open Folder"**. **Do not use "Open Recent"**

So my assumption is that the project/folder name was cached somehow.

- VSCode Version: 1.11.2
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launch VS Code from the Dock or the Finder (NOT from the command line)
2. In a terminal, run `code -w &lt;file&gt;`
3. =&gt; file opens
4. Exit VS code using &lt;kbd&gt;Cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Q&lt;/kdb&gt;
5. =&gt; `code -w &lt;file&gt;` does not returns

Expected result:
`code -w &lt;file&gt;` should have returned.

It is worth noting that after VS Code is exited and even if `code -w &lt;file&gt;` is interrupted with &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt;, VS Code can no longer be launched from the Finder or the Dock. Clicking on the app icon will do nothing. VS Code can however still be launched from the command line.

It would be very helpful to allow more than one set of references / location list / peek widget to be shown at the same time.

For example, in this image I'm looking at all `IpcMessage` derived types. If I want to look at the references of `IpcQuit`, the derived type reference view is closed and cannot be easily retrieved (especially if I've navigated to a separate part of the code base).

    <Title>Vscode auto format spaces before and after curly brackets</Title>
    <Description>The auto formatting on vscode is great but in jsx if you do e.g.

Import {NamedExport} from 'blah' 

The auto formatter will do:

Import { NamedExport } from 'blah' 

Which is rather annoying. The applicable settings are all set to false so please don't suggest setting any of the usual suspects to false as per stackoverflow and Twitter.

It seems like an issue in vscode itself.

Please advise.</Description>

    <Title>Allow setting for bash config</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

I often use the builtin terminal pane in VSCode. When using bash (bin/bash) with default macOS configuration from .bash_profile it will not be loaded by code. VSCode expects a .bashrc in the home directory. It would be nice if we can configure the bash conf path. At the moment I work around this by having a bashconf file and symlinking this to .bash_profile and .bashrc. But I think a preference for the configuration file would be a better solution. 

I still need .bash_profile because it is used by the macOS terminal application.

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.3

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open VSCode and hit _ctrl+&lt;_ (german keyboard) to open bash (default in linux and macOS)
2. no configuration loaded, a blank bash if no configuration was added to .bashrc</Description>

A similar comparing tool as the plugin explained in StackOverflow above. Currently, VSCode does not allow multi select and also ability to edit the compared files (only the file to the right is allowed).

1. Multi-select files in the tabs
2. Compare and edit both the files

You are now shown both versions of the filename. You can actually open those two files separately, but you will end up in a twilight zone. Edits in either of the file views will be saved to the actual file, but not render in the other file view. 

I haven't investigated exactly what happens, but I can tell you that trouble lies ahead. I lost half an hour of editing because I accidentally opened the small caps file and made a change. Didn't catch that this file was an old version of the real file. The real file got overwritten :(

Solution: Quick-open should NOT show files that does not exist.

Apart from this problem I'm really happy that I switched from Atom. VSCode is great!

VSCode works fine with internet connection and even in LAN, so I guess there's nothing to require via the internet. But when I try to start VSCode without any network connection, nothing happened. No matter how many times I click on, it won't start and I cannot find the program in task manager.

    <Description>Testing for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23305

- VSCode Version: Insiders
- OS Version: Windows

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an empty folder with no git configuration
2. Click the SCM icon in the activity bar

I expect to see a "Git init" action that is more clear. It was unclear to me what clicking the git icon would do.

    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;
Ref: #23283

- VSCode Version: 1.11.0
- OS Version: Win10
- Node Protocol: inspect and legacy

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Initiate remote debugging session.
2. Set a breakpoint in any of the &lt;node_internals&gt; file and hit it. 
3. Close the file without any scrolling after the breakpoint was hit.
4. Open the same script via `Debug: Open Loaded Script`. 

The opened script is scrolled to the top, whereas expected to scrolled to the same line, where it stayed after step 3.

Hitting the breakpoint, then navigating to another file and back also resets the scrolling position.</Description>

Right click on a default keybinding
Choose remove
Confirm
The reset keybindings is not available

It is possible the current model where defaults are removed make this difficult to implement properly. Perhaps we need a different call in the service to get the defaults and this action can be based on the actual defaults rather than the "resolved" defaults.

    <Title>List Filter Viewlet</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.3

It would be nice to have a list filter viewlet that I can bind to a key command.  This would effectively allow me to filter out a list when focused with vim-like key commands.

The idea is that once invoked, a text area would appear and allow you to enter your filter criteria.  The list would either filter items or move your selection to the appropriate input.

Eg:
I might use the following key commands to navigate to File Explorer, and then filter out the list to a particluar file:

```
// Place your key bindings in this file to overwrite the defaults
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+h",
    "command": "workbench.view.explorer",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
  // New (proposed)
  {
    "key": "/",
    "command": "list.showFilterViewlet",
    "when": "explorerViewletVisible &amp;&amp; filesExplorerFocus"
  }
]```</Description>

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a simple project using launch.json and an electron entry file.
2. try to debug main process. 

### What happens?
VSCode resolves the path of the `runtimeExecutable` wrong. Instead of `D:\Data\Desktop\theclassic-desktop/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd` VSCode creates the path `d:\Data\Desktop\theclassic-desktop/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd`, which does not exist on the device. Therefore the launch failes with no errors thrown (except an entry within the `CALL STACK` pane under the debug view. It says `No call stack available (vscode_backtrace: Internal Error: undefined is not a function)`. 

My `launch.json` looks like this:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [{
    "name": "Debug Main Process",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
    "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
    "windows": {
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
    },
    "program": "${workspaceRoot}/src/main-process/main.js"
  }],
  "compounds": []
}
```

Looks like `${workspaceRoot}` lowers the first letter for some reason.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a workspace which has additional directories in `search.exclude`
2. Open "Go To File" (Cmd + P)
3. Type in something that matches something in an excluded directory
4. Excluded files show up (for example files in `node_modules`)

Until I updated VSCode today, all files from the excluded directories were also excluded from "Go To File".

That doesn't make any sense to me. Clearly `wand.ts` should still be the top match because the characters I've typed are the closest together in `wand.ts`.

    <Title>Undo History &amp; The Journal of Irreproducible Results</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: MacOS Sierra

Steps to Reproduce:

Haha. No way. I tried. It's completely random. Crazy making.

Here is the deal:

I looked at a couple open issues about Undo History in this repo. You guys assert that the history is infinite unless the file is written to by another process. My experience conflicts with that. On several very frustrating occasions, I lose all Undo history right after I save. I do have a process that watches the file and updates the build after each save but that process does not modify the file itself, at least not in any way that I can tell visually or content wise. But even if it turns out to be some crazy thing on my end (maybe one of the tools opens and saves the file as is instead of just reading from it) the fact that an editor loses its Undo history is enough for me and most developers (trust me, when enough run into this) to dump this otherwise great piece of software.

Would you consider being a normal editor like Sublime et al and preserve the Undo history in the same way those editors do? I've never had a single complaint in my whole adult life about something as trivial as this.

Please fix (something, not me)

    <Title>Unfocused Tab Is Same Color as Focused Extension Tab Header (With No Tab Border) - Many Themes Affected</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: Win 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code with the Welcome tab open
2. Open one of the extension's tabs by clicking on an extension
3. Select Dark (Visual Studio) theme (as an example) - many other themes have this problem too
4, The extension's header has the same color as the non-focused tab (with no borders either)
5. Switch between the tabs - which tab do you think you are on? It makes me think I am on the Welcome tab and clicking the different colored Extension tab does nothing (because I'm already on that tab).
6. An example of where this confusion does not occur is the the High Contrast theme (because there are borders on the tab and tab with focus gets outlined with a different color) or Red theme (because the header is appropriately not the same color as the unfocused tab).

I can provide screenshots if necessary for clarification.

VS Code doesn't update.  When I start it, it tells me that it will update the next time it restarts.  I click "Update Now" or click "Later" and close it on my own and it closes but does not ever restart.  When I start it again manually I get the update message again.  I have tried disabling all plugins and still have the issue.

- VSCode Version: Version 1.9.1 (1.9.1)
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32)

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Click "Update Now" when the update notification appears.
3.  Notice that VS Code closes but never reopens.
4.  Open VS Code again.
5.  Notice the update notification appears again.
6.  GOTO step 2.

I get this error on startup, but after disabling material icons and restarting it goes away but VS Code still won't update.:

Actual:

Gives focus to previously launched VS Code instance

Workaround:

Once previous instance is given focus, you can Ctrl+Shift+N to do what the Windows shortcut would normally do.</Description>

    <Title>Debug controls cover editor tabs!</Title>
    <Description>I find that I'm constantly moving the debug controls around to see the editor tabs!
It's really annoying!

- VSCode Version: Version 1.10.2 (1.10.2)
- OS Version: OSX

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a bunch of tabs
2. Start debugging
3. Having multiple debug sessions running increases the problem because the controls become wider and cover even more tabs! I have multiple sessions running a lot for server, message queue and client side debugging.

I would prefer to have the debug toolbar in the debug console (beside the clear console button) 

Or the debug sidebar (above the call stack would make logical sense grouping things related where the debugger currently is).

Or have it beside the editor tabs not overlaying them but this isn't ideal either because it reduces the space available for tabs.

Or overlay the status bar at the bottom! There's tons of blank space there in the middle and the status bar already turns orange when a debug session is active. 

Or just just add a toolbar row at the top and shift the top of the editor tabs/sidebar down

Ideally there would be customizable preferences for how to display the debug controls so you could have it in any or all of these places!

    <Title>Scrolling with touchpad behaves like pressing up and down arrow keys</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

I have a laptop with touchpad and scrolling (by touching the touchpad with two fingers and sliding them vertically) file content, files list, terminal window or anything inside VSCode behaves like I am pressing an holding up/down arrow keys. This behavior is not only annoying but it doesn't allow me to scroll say terminal window, because scrolling simply shows the list of last run commands - the same as if you press up arrow key multiple times. Horizontal scrolling behaves as left/right arrow keys - instead of scrolling horizontally, I move the caret. I have a wireless Microsoft mouse and when I use it for scrolling, everything works a expected. When I use my touchpad to scroll in the same way any other application like Chrome, Notepad, whatever, it behaves normally (the caret stays on its location and only the view is scrolled - actually I can normally scroll this GitHub's text area I am writing the issue text in). Does anyone have such problem with VSCode ? Could it because of touchpad drivers (I think mine is "ELAN Pointing Device") ?

List of extensions:
1 Debugger for Chrome 2.7.0
2. Git History (git log) 0.2.0
3. TSLint 0.8.1
4. vscode-icons 7.4.0

I tried to disable all extensions and reload VSCode but nothing changed.

The video below is made without using arrows keys - only scrolling functionality of my touchpad.

    <Title>Treat file-reload as an undoable "edit".</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.10.2 8076a19fdcab7e1fc1707952d652f0bb6c6db331
- OS Version: N/A

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have a file open in VSCode.
2. Change the file outside VSCode.
3. In VSCode, the file reloads automatically.
4. Realise that you didn't mean to make that change.
5. Apply palm to face.

Some other editors treat the reloading of the file as an edit. This gives the careless user a reprieve if they accidentally blow away work on the command line (`git checkout .`, anyone?). They can simply invoke undo to get back to the state the file was in before the mishap.

This would also preserve undo history in the event of a reload.</Description>

It would be great to have a way to send your code to a printer.  Looked at the keybindings...nothing.  Googled it...nothing.  Searched the product....nothing.  Please add this functionality soon.  (i.e. navigate from File in Menu to "Print &lt;name of file&gt;...".

You may think nobody actually uses that, but it's a standard feature in practically every text-editor since the dawn of time, and it does have it's uses.

Typically the cursor changes from a vertical line to a block when overwrite is toggled on.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Init VSCode and Change the keyboard language.
2. Use a keyboard shortcut that is different from the previous language.

For example I have a Portuguese keyboard and an English one. If I change the keyboard language from Portuguese to English `CMD + /` doesn't work to comment code until I restart VSCode.

Currently, we can always show `OUTPUT`, `DEBUG CONSOLE` and `TERMINAL` panel using APIs.

But for the `PROBLEMS` panel, we can only display it manually.

So is there any existing API to show the `PROBLEMS` panel, or maybe VSCode can support it in the future?</Description>

    <Title>"files.autoSave": "onFocusChange"</Title>

- VSCode Version: 1.10.2
- OS Version: Linux Ubuntu 16.04

Problem:
`"files.autoSave": "onFocusChange"` not working correctly. I write something in file, I switch to another file, but it will not be auto-saved. For e.g. I change code in `server.js`, I switch to `client.js` it will not be saved. As I read here https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/353, @bpasero said:

&gt; you switch to another file or close the file
&gt; you quit the app
&gt; you move to another app so that code looses focus

P.S. It only works if I change to Untitled document which is created, but not saved and only for the first time.

I don't know if it's problem, but I will be really in love with such function.

    <Title>Collapse all children in explorer tree?</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.10.0
- OS Version: 10.12.3

It would be most convenient if I could right-click a folder in the explorer tree and choose "collapse all children".  

Many times, over the course of the day, I have opened many folders and subfolders.  This makes it difficult to focus/locate what I am currently working on.  I need to close each folder and its parent(s) in turn.

MacOS' Finder has the ability to collapse a folder and all child folders by option-click on the disclosure
 triangle, as in

As you can see when I re-open it, the child folder had been closed along with its parent.

I would love to be able to do this with my main "app" folder, and then open it and open the child module I need to actually work on.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open multiple tabs from your project
2. Start a debugging session
3. Notice that the debug toolbar overlaps with the tab bar.
4. We can only move the toolbar left or right but we cannot get rid of the overlap.

Expectation
It may not be an issue to have a fixed mini toolbar above the tab-bar. Launching a debug session, stopping, restarting, step-over, etc can be buttons on there.</Description>

5. Type: test(

Bug: The results are buggy (see the screenshot) -- it shows "int test(int a, int aint aint aa)" with the 2nd "int a" underlined. It appears to be a VS Code bug. The expected result is "int test(int a, int aa)" with the first "int a" underlined. You get correct results if the paramaters are not a subset of each other. In other words, the bug repros because "int a" is a subset of "int aa". The result we send back to VS Code is:

In the aforementioned issue TypeScript return a stale code action suggesting to add an import even though it has been added already.

I'm building a new extension [Restore Editors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.restore-editors) to be able to save the current set of editors to be re-opened at a later time. Currently I am employing some [serious hackery](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-restore-editors/blob/master/src/documentManager.ts#L57) to get a list of the opened editors.

It would be great if there was an api that an extension could use to get at that information. Ideally this would provide even more information than is accessible now -- in addition to the `uri` and `viewColumn`, it would be great if there was an `position` that would tell the order of the editors inside a column.</Description>

    <Title>A better way to provide multi-line Snippets support</Title>
    <Description>ps: I'm not  excellent in English, but I'll try to make it clear.

now, we add custom snippets use json file, for example, add a for loop snippets:
```json
"For Loop": {
        "prefix": "for",
        "body": [
            "for (var ${1:index} = 0; ${1:index} &lt; ${2:array}.length; ${1:index}++) {",
            "\tvar ${3:element} = ${2:array}[${1:index}];",
            "\t$0",
            "}"
        ],
        "description": "For Loop"
    }
```
In `body`, we need add useless quotes and `\t` for good format, I think this is not good enough.

But if we use some Notations like  [CSON]("https://github.com/bevry/cson"), we write snippets will like this:
```
'For Loop':
    'prefix': 'for'
    'body': """
        for (var ${1:index} = 0; ${1:index} &lt; ${2:array}.length; ${1:index}++) {
            var ${3:element} = ${2:array}[${1:index}];
            $0
            }
"""
```
I think this is a better way to write snippets.
or we just use it like
#15140

This is somewhat related to #10782 on the functionality side and to #5770 on the UI side.

    <Title>Single line code collapsing</Title>
    <Description>Currently when you collapse code block you get two lines. Something like this.
```js
get CurrentSession(): DialerCampaignSessionModel {...
}
```
This is quite unreadable when you collaps a lot of blocks and also IMO the whole point of collapsings is to get as few lines as possible. For me, following is much better and more readable.
```js
get CurrentSession(): DialerCampaignSessionModel {...}
```
It will be nice if there was option to select collapsing type. Of course it should work for all languages.

It would be great to have more control over a Quickpick. Here are some things I would love to have.

1. Stream or push items into a Quickpick (basically be able to show/add more items to the list as promises are resolved)
1. Update the placeholder dynamically
1. Control which item should be selected when shown
1. Add event for `right-arrow` press on an item, similar to the file access quickpick
1. Seed the inputbox with a value

    <Title>Focusing debug console or output hides TypeScript version being used in status bar</Title>
    <Description>#21037

It's strange to see the status bar jump around like this, especially when you click the debug console's monaco editor (the status bar item hides on mousedown, and show on mouseup).

It's happening because output and debug console are using monaco editors. The status bar item should show based on the last active editor, not the currently active monaco instance.

For the following code:

 */
FibonacciHeap.prototype.findMinimum = function () {
  return this.minNode;
};
```

1. Put cursor at end of the second line (Returns the minimum...)
2. Press up, intellisense is triggered wrongly, making navigation with arrow keys difficult if you have block comments in your code. This also happens when navigating using page up/down.

We should also take in consideration _consecutive_ characters, not just whether their position is early in the string.

I.e. consecutive characters always should sort before: 1 match (`icon`) should always be before two matches (`i` and `con`).</Description>

Since we now support Add Configuration in the drop down one option is to no longer show this in-place button (should verify with telemetry).

    <Title>Newline in Files search Regex not working</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.9.1
- OS Version: Mac OS 10.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to the Search sidebar
2. Turn on Regex
3. Search for something like "module\.exports\.(.*);" (without the quotes) - that works OK
4. Change that to "module\.exports\.(.*);\n" - still works OK
5. Change that to "module\.exports\.(.*);\nfunction" - does only find in the open files.
6. Note that in the editor search/replace (CMD-F), it works perfect (both search and replace too)

To make things even worse, when the search sidebar finds something using a regex with newline, if you try to use Replace, the sidebar UI gets completely screwed.

    <Description>It would be great if:

 - it was possible to click and drag the "selection window" to move onto the minimap: releasing the mouse would show the text at current position
 - the minimap didn't scroll and was showing the whole document: right now, depending on the document size, you first have to scroll a little to view the part where you want to navigate to, and then only you make click on the position you want to move the view

What I call "window" is the highlighed square that indicates what part of the document is currently visible:

    <Description>This is on Windows and I noticed it on Thursday or Friday. When using a relative parent folder path in the terminal it is causing weird spacing issues when moving the cursor. @Tyriar I wasn't sure if this was an issue in code or upstream

If the cursor is at the end of the line it forces the `..` to join the previous command in the prompt. I added a gif showing the behavior

2. The `..` will have spacing issues with the **cd** depending on where the cursor is.

The `vscode.open` command seems to be the only way to open a document in a "preview" tab, but currently it steals focus. While `window.showTextDocument` doesn't have an option to show in a "preview" tab (might be a nice option as well), but does support `preserveFocus?: boolean`.

- VSCode Version: 1.10.0-insider
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.3

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use any means to open a file, say Ctrl/Cmd+P, while the focus is in one of the editor groups
1. The file opens in that editor group
1. Move to any other editor group
1. Open same file, it is opened again, this time in the current editor group

While this behavior _is not incorrect in any sense_, it leads to proliferation of (same) files open which wastes memory, if not other resources. Honestly, I don't care about memory consumption, but mentally I am arranging files open (sometimes) to the left/right and would like the "stability" of the same file always being open in the same editor-group (I make sure that I open the file in question in the "appropriate" editor-group, I don't expect any kind of automatic placement).

It would be **really** nice if we'd have a toggle (boolean setting) which would toggle from current behavior (would be the default) and the one where however I open the file, if it's already open in an editor-group, it's simply focused there.

It might be naive, but I assume that this is a rather simple thing to implement.</Description>

    <Title>Untracked Items added to Source Control on Commit All</Title>
    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.9.1
- OS Version: Windows 7 SP1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add new files to working directory 
2. New files with show up in GIT with a status of untracked
3. Do not add any staged items 
4. Add a comment and select commit all
5. All unstaged are added to source control

This would appear to be an issue since I would not expect untracked items to be added to source control when I press commit all. Only untacked items that I add to the index should be added and the rest should be ignored and left with a status of untacked.

    <Title>Installation of "the 'SQL' extension" recommended, not available.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.9.1
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.3

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a .sql file
2. Observe recommendation notice.
3. Click "Show Recommendations"

&lt;img width="724" alt="screen shot 2017-02-16 at 07 22 48" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/76547/23024768/cad1d4da-f418-11e6-9aca-d813fad3cb84.png"&gt;

At the top of the window, the recommendation notice comes down with the message: "It is recommended to install the 'SQL' extension." Buttons presented are "Show Recommendations" "Don't Show Again" and "Close". Clicking Show Recommendations presents a list of extensions that does not include any titled "SQL", the closest would be the Microsoft SQL Server-specific "mssql" extension. Searching all extensions for the substring "SQL" shows no extension with the title of simply "SQL".

If the intent of the notice is to encourage the user to select one of the SQL-related extensions, e.g., mssql, PL/SQL, vscode-database, then the Show button should take the user to a list of extensions tagged as SQL related, and the wording of the notice should be corrected, as "the 'SQL' extension" means one specific, so named extension.

If there is/was a specific extension simply called "SQL" that is not available at this moment, the notice could be removed or linked directly to that extension. Even if the extension is not available, it would be a clearer user-experience to click Show… and be taken to a "this extension is no longer available" page.</Description>

    <Title>Navigate among the files while typing in the Explorer panel</Title>
    <Description>
- VSCode Version:1.8.1
- OS Version: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]

Steps to Reproduce:
In Visual Studio, we could navigate between the files while typing to search the file or folder that we want to reach.

For example, let's suppose that we have the following structure on Explorer panel
- resources
- config
  + acl.php
  + app.php
  +benchmark.php
- config.testing
- database
- routes

If I start to type "c", "o", "n" with the focus inside the **Explorer bar**, so, the panel will set the focus to the **config** folder. Once inside the **config** folder and start to type "a", "p"... it will set the focus in the **app.php file**.

If the **Explorer** panel has the focus in the **resource** folder and we start to type "b", "e","n", the **Explorer** panel will set the focus to the **benchmark.php** or other file that starts with the chars "ben".

In split screen look like someone tired to fix the disappearing scrollbar bug, which still exist, but now I've lost a big chuck of screen real-estate which I would like returned. This is more so a problem in split view when I am looking am editing markdown file and looking at preview side by side.

    <Description>&lt;!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode --&gt;

- VSCode Version: 1.9.x
- OS Version: Windows

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Follow the smoke and search for body
2. Replace with body2
3. Select a match and press replace

Observe: the match is not removed since body still matches. I would not expect this.

    <Title>Having parameters for tasks would be very useful</Title>

- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: macOS 10.12.3

It would be very useful to have a way of prompting for additional arguments to tasks.
Something similar to the [snippet style](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets#_creating-your-own-snippets) could be used to prompt for additional arguments.
This way tasks, or commands like the following could be done straight from vscode:

- `bin/rails g migration AddHostNameToUrl host_name:string`
  could be defined as: `bin/rails g migration ${1:MigrationName} ${2:field:type}` 
- `bin/rails db:rollback STEP=2`
  could be defined as: `bin/rails db:rollback STEP=${1}` 

These are examples for rails/rake, but the same applies to yeoman generators

- `yo angular:controller MyNewController`
  could be defined as: `yo angular:controller ${1:ControllerName}`

Despite the shortcut being part of the standard set of shortcuts (at least under Linux, it's Ctrl+K Ctrl+H)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Check the default keybindings.json (Linux):
`{ "key": "ctrl+k ctrl+h",         "command": "workbench.action.output.toggleOutput" },`
2. Look at the View menu, the "Output" item has no shortcut listed. I spent a few minutes trying to add one only to find that it already existed, it just wasn't being shown in the menu.</Description>

With the exception of my workspace specific stuff, I have found most (all?) of my settings in `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders`. But then I find my extensions in `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode-insiders`.

Is this how it's supposed to be? Perhaps it's just me that find it cumbersome to locate everything.</Description>

    <Title>Close window dialogue gets shown multiple times on pressing 'Cancel'</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Sierra 10.12.2

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new file
2. Put something into that file so that it brings up a dialogue when trying to close it
3. Press cmd-w (close window) multiple times
4. Click cancel

The same dialogue will come up multiple times rather than cancelling the rest of the stack of close commands.

**Possible expected results:**
- The rest of the commands are removed
- The focus moves to the next tab upon pressing cancel and that one is attempted to be closed instead

Create the following extension:
```typescript
'use strict';
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () =&gt; {
        if (!vscode.window.activeTextEditor) {
            console.log('No editor');
            return;
        }
        let doc= vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document;
        let lines= [ doc.lineAt(0).range, doc.lineAt(2).range];
        vscode.window.activeTextEditor.insertSnippet(new vscode.SnippetString('for (var ${1:i}=0; ${1:i}&lt;len; ${1:i}++) { $0 }'), lines);
    });

    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}
```

- run the extension, open an editor and run the 'hello world' command.
Only the first line is replaced. I somehow expected that the first and third line are affected.

    <Title>VSCode does not like inline CSS</Title>
    <Description>We all know inline CSS is a really bad practice and should be avoided at all costs by any web developer. Yeah, right. But VS Code seems to be taking this rather too seriously and applying bad formatting to any HTML after a style attribute in HTML document, shifting every line after the rotten one to the left, therefore messing the indentation completely.

## How to reproduce

1. Open a new VS Code window
2. Set language to HTML (Control+K, M then type HTML)
3. Paste in the following code:


```
&lt;html&gt;  
    &lt;body&gt;
        
        &lt;div style="border:1 px solid red"&gt;I'm a block element&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm a second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm a third paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

```
4. Format code with Control+Shift+F

And it's done! The code will look like this:


```
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;div style="border:1 px solid red"&gt;I'm a block element&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a third paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
```

Notice the 3 empty lines and how the `&lt;p&gt;` tags have shifted leftwards?

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VSCode (restored)
2. Open integrated terminal (I am using WSL Bash in it, not sure if it matters)
3. Maximize the window
4. Type a long line in the integrated terminal.

As a result, the line will wrap at that point where it would have wrapped in the non-maximized window, but it won't even wrap into the next line, but just start at the left side of the same line again.

Have some settings set in your user/workspace settings and format the file.
Ensure one of the settings is such that it needs a json object as value.
For eg:

    <Description>Testing https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19049

In the Git viewlet, 'sync' and 'publish' under the '...' menu are disabled when the repo has no remotes. In the SCM viewlet, when I click 'sync', I see `fatal: No remote repository specified. Please, specify either a URL or a`. In the git output log, I see that there's a newline in the message at that point. Maybe when git output is shown directly as a notification, lines should be joined.</Description>

    <Title>No debugging without launch.json file when using debugger from extension</Title>
    <Description>Testing #18397 on Windows

- I have the Go extension installed and Go workspace opened with no launch.json file.
- There is a Go file opened in the active editor.
- I have added a breakpoint
- I click on the gear button in the debug side pane to create the launch.json file and there is a pop up asking me to choose the environment.
- I chose Go

Nothing happens. Debugger is not started.

In case you don't have Go and the Go extension installed, follow the below steps:
1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)
2. Setup GOPATH
       1. Choose a folder where you will be having the Go projects
       2. Add env variable GOPATH with value as the above folder path
       3. Create 3 folders "src", "bin" and "pkg"
3. Run `go get github.com/golang/example/hello`
4. Install the Go extension by lukehoban and open the folder $GOPATH/src/GitHub.com/golang/example/hello in VS Code
5. Open the `hello.go` file. You will see "Analysis Tools Missing" in the status bar. Click on it to install the Go tools that the extension needs.

1. Take the latest chrome debug vsix from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19110#issue-202734053)
2. Install it in insiders and open vscode repository, choose launch vscode
3. Notice how the debugger can not attach - this is captured in a different bug
4. Stop the debug session, click on stop twice - this should kill the debug extension
5. Activity monitor - however the chrome extension is still running with 100% cpu as a code helper

Assigning to @weinand since he authored this [code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/rawDebugSession.ts#L493) and @roblourens  since his extension seems to go into a weird state

I know that you keep that space to show when a file is dirty, but if a file gets dirty the tab area should grow automatically imho

    <Title>git reset -p : Reset line per line (and maybe per block too)</Title>
    <Description>it would be super nice to have the equivalent of `git reset -p`.

We can add and remove selectively what we want to be in staging or not, but I haven't find an option to reset lines/blocks.

Thanks for VSC, it's awesome :heart: !

    <Title>RPM package has incomplete list of dependencies</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: CentOS 7.3 (x64)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install CentOS 7.3 minimal ISO to a new VM
2. sudo yum install code-1.8.1-1482158209.el7.x86_64.rpm
3. code .

Expected:
VS Code to start

Actual:
VS Code crashes, saying it cannot find libgtk-2.0.so
I then manually installed the "gtk2" rpm to meet the missing dependency.

VS Code still crashes, saying it cannot find libXtst.so.
I installed the "libXtst" rpm

VS Code still crashes, saying it cannot find libgconf-2.0.so
I installed the "GConf2" rpm

VS Code starts, but immediately and silently exits. Running with the --verbose option eventually points to a failure to locate a "sans" font.

I installed the "gnu-free-sans-fonts" rpm
VS Code successfully starts and is operational.

So it seems like the above 4 packages should be added as package dependencies, to avoid the user having to manually find/install additional packages.

    <Title>vscode-insiders embed terminal behavior since 1.9.0</Title>
    <Description>Hi!

I've an issue with latest update.

```
Version 1.9.0-insider
Commit 882244ea24cb0b89a9a0c6c649c8f857fb0bc408
Date 2017-01-23T07:03:07.900Z
Shell 1.4.6
Renderer 53.0.2785.143
Node 6.5.0
```

OS: Debian 8

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launch `vim` in the embed terminal

Used to work before `1.9.0`. Now I can't do my `git commit` command anymore because it does open the `$EDITOR`. 

Nano, less etc. are still working. Therefore, I think it has to do with my vim configuration. What are recent changes that could affect this? Note that `vi` prints black on black.

    <Title>Go to File includes files that are excluded by files.exclude/search.exclude</Title>
    <Description>My build process compiles files to public/*.html, and i'm trying to exclude the compiled files from search and Go to File.

My workspace settings looks like this:

```json
{
    "search.exclude": {
        "**/.git": true,
        "**/node_modules": true,
        "**/public": true,
        "**/bower_components": true
    },

    "files.exclude": {
        "**/public": true
    }
}
```

The settings seems to be applied to search and file explorer, but it's still appearing in the Go to File results.

I can't find any option in the default config that applies specifically to the Go to File results.

- VSCode Version: 1.8.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Apply the settings above to your workspace
2. Create a couple `.html` files in a folder called `public`

    <Title>Editors are identified case-sensitively on case-insensitive file systems leading to multiple editors for the same underlying file</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

On Windows:
1. Open the same file twice via the command line but using different case, ie, `code foo` and `code FOO`.
2. There will be two editors open despite being backed by the same underlying file.

This is not limited to just the command line API, ie, a debugger can open up a file with a different case than what is present on the file-system which ends up causing breakpoints to not display properly.</Description>

- VSCode Version: 1.9.0 - insider
- OS Version: macOS Sierra Version 10.12.2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Select a text to replace with blank string (zero length string).
2. Press cmd-opt-F to open search-replace box.
3. Ensure that the selected text is now in the first textbox of search-replace box.
4. Ensure nothing is typed in second textbox (Replace) of search-replace box.
5 Click on 'Replace' or 'Replace All' buttons (adjacent to replace textbox).

**Expected Result**: 
Occurrences of text on search box should get replaced by blank zero length string (regular normal behaviour in any rext editor).

**Actual Result**:
Nothing happens!

    <Title>Git Bash integrated terminal odd behaviour</Title>
    <Description>A few integrated terminal commands using Git Bash have some odd behavior right off the bat with this newest release of Insider.

The `clear` command results in:
```
$ clear
'bash.exe': unknown terminal type.
```

`vim` results in:
```
$ vim Vagrantfile
E437: terminal capability "cm" required
Press ENTER or type command to continue
```
Then after pressing enter, vim launches but all the spacing is messed up.

Also, backspace just adds spaces now.  And it seems like the up/down keys just keep appending previous commands rather than cycling through them.

Let me know if there is any testing needed on my end.

    <Title>Trimming trailing spaces based on file type</Title>
    <Description>Hi there,

I love auto trimming trailing spaces but I had to turn it off because in certain file types it breaks the syntax. For instance Jade/Pug.
It would be great if I could specify where the trimming would be disabled. Something like:

```json
files.trimTrailingWhitespaceExclude: [
    ".jade",
    ".pug",
]
```

Just simple extension recognition would do the job.

    <Title>Feature request: add API to add custom icons and functionality behind it to left bar.</Title>
    <Description>Currently on **left side bar** VSCode have **only 5 icons** (explorer, search, git, debug, extensions).
**Below** this icons there is really huge **empty area**.

It would we great if we will have some **API to add custom icons** to this area and assign some command to it (as I know there is _such possibility but only for bottom bar_).

 Some action require couple step to perform it (run some command):
 - _open command palette_
 - _search some command and perform it_
 - _if in current command there is subcommands we need to perform couple command selection..._

We can avoid this buy adding special icon with assigned action to left bar - **only on click** to perform some **command** (it will save us a lot of time during development).


For example on _Atom_ there is extension _"tool-bar"_ https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar that implement such functionality:

    <Title>Prompts aren't focused for keyboard selection.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro

The default behaviour is for the focus is to remain on the editor and not move to the prompt for easy selection using the keyboard (i.e. left &amp; right arrow keys). This forces users to have to reach for their mouse.

Example:
![Alt Text](http://i.imgur.com/7kvh9ta.png "grr")

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Do anything that causes a prompt to be displayed (i.e. try to run a task without terminating an existing task)
2. Result, focus returns to the text editor view and not to the prompt.

This would be really great if this could be implemented and I don't think anyone would disapprove.

It might not be a valid issue, I just find it annoying. In Interface Overview, pressing `ctrl+shift+p` will launch the command palette under the overlay, and I can still type in the palette. While if I want to play around with the sidebar, I have click twice, the first one dismiss the overlay and the second one does the trigger.</Description>

    <Title>Php variables turns into HTML tags</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: osX 10.12
- Extensions installed: 
    - None, base VSC install

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open up a .php file
2. Within a php file (in my case a functions file for Wordpress) when I go to create a variable, eg: `$sm_content`, it turns it into `&lt;1sm_content&gt;&lt;/1sm_content&gt;` upon hitting tab. Hitting space before hitting tab does not cause this, only when the cursor is right up against the variable name.
3. Restarted VSC, still same results.

    <Title>[snippets] Support for regular expressions with Snippet Variables</Title>
    <Description>It'd be nice if regular expression support is added to the new snippet syntax (great work btw!! 👍). With variables such as "TM_FILENAME", the *extension* of the file is also added when the snippet is expanded, and when using snippets in code (eg. React), it's rarely the case that I'd need the extension of the file, thus I feel the need to have functionality to remove it from the replaced string.

I think this might be related closely to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6920?

    <Title>Save As...dialog should also include a choice to save as administrator/root</Title>
    <Description>This is a feature request :-)

VSCode Version 1.8.1
Commit ee428b0eead68bf0fb99ab5fdc4439be227b6281
Date 2016-12-19T14:41:20.664Z
Shell 1.4.6
Renderer 53.0.2785.143
Node 6.5.0
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

When saving a file, I get a "Failed to save 'default': A system error occured (EACCES: permission denied, open '/etc/nginx/sites-available/default')" because I'm saving the file as a regular user, rather than admin/root. This is as it should be. But I should also get a prompt that allows me to enter root/pw so that I can go ahead and save. 

I think it makes sense to put that in the "Save As..." dialog, because I think to myself "Yeah, save as root". As for details of the process of that...I'm not sure. Maybe once you hit save and you get the permission denied, it can prompt w/ username/pw for whatever user (generally root) is needed to save in that spot.

    <Title>Allow getting path of a non-textual file</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Win10

Unless I'm missing something it's impossible to get file object (or simply file path as string) in extension if you have a non-textual file open.

The use case here is that you open let's say an image file, or docx file in vscode, and you want to provide a hotkey for opening this file in your default app associated with given extension. This is a case that I wanted to fix in a small extension sandcastle/vscode-open#2.

For text file it's simple because you could simply get `vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document`, but that's not a case in case of any format unsupported by VSCode.

I tried to get a inspiration using `workbench.action.files.copyPathOfActiveFile` command, so it took me to [`GlobalCopyPathAction`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/e179ec75abb7c3cb225001269561d4a31fe9b673/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/electron-browser/electronFileActions.ts#L89) class, but it uses `editorService` which  I believe is not exposed to extensions API.</Description>

This is annoying if you have a folder open in one window, and another window showing another file (e.g. to compare/for reference). If you close the folder-based window, you can't open it again until you close all other windows, or replace the existing window, which you then have to open again afterwards.</Description>

Currently in vscode you can't select more then one file at a time. For example if you want to move multiple files in another folder you have to do it one by one or use the OS file manager. It would be great to have this as well in vscode.

    <Title>Middleclick in Ubuntu Unity Launcher does not open a new window</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.1
- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Middle-click on the Unity Launcher Icon.
2. The load mouse indicator appears and disappears again. Then nothing happens.

This is breaking Ubuntus default behaviour of opening a new instance of the application upon a middle click. A left click brings the running app instance to the front or launches a new one (works) and a right click opens the context menu (works).

As a workaround I have to spawn a new window from the file menu each time I need a new instance, which feels really broken.

    <Title>Feature Request: Terminal Tabs</Title>
    <Description># Feature Request
## Terminal Tabs
There's already a plug-in worth mentioning which enables tabs in the blue bar below the terminal but they are merely just small icons. 

## Suggestions
- Tabs Located Beside "Terminal" That Are Actually Tabs.
  - Or Include The "Terminal" Name as a Tab(Which Can Be Renamed), And A (+) Icon To Add More Tabs Which Can Be Renamed.
- Optional Coloured Tabs
- Quick Switching Between Tabs (alt 1-9)
- Ability To Name, and Rename, Close Button
- Save Tabs For Better Workflow

    <Title>Hot-Exit: works only if there is one instance (window) of VS Code open</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.9.0-insider (also reproducible in 1.8.0)
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code anywhere, create new file, write something but don't save
2. Open another VS Code window ( Ctrl+Shift+N ), create new file, write something but don't save
3. Close either window

The expected behavior would be for the hot-exit feature to kick in and not to display the file-save prompt.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or a missing feature.

Well, probably a more common and practical use case would be to open two folders into separate VS Code windows.</Description>

I noticed that when I have a bunch of untitled-unsaved files with hotexit enabled and if I open a file from explorer, if I close VSCode and open it only the untitled-unsaved files will be restored and not the file I opened from explorer.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create new untitled-unsaved tabs 
2. Click File -&gt; Open File -&gt; and choose a random file
3. Close VSCode
4. Reopen VSCode and notice how the file you chose in step 2 is not restored

    <Title>Make markdown links without protocol (iE /README.md) map to file system</Title>
    <Description>Yes, in markdown i can set file links using the `file://path/to/my/file.md` syntax to create file links. However, this depends on where i cloned the repo on my computer.

When I write documentation in markdown, I can link between documents in the following way

```
linked from /doc/documentation.md
* [back](../README.md) 
* [back absolute](/README.md)
```
As expected, a relative link is relative to the current file, an absolute link is resolved to the project root

Here are working examples on [github](https://github.com/fbehrens/doc-example/blob/master/doc/documentation.md) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fbehrens/doc-example/blob/master/doc/documentation.md)

It would be very useful, if those links would also work in VSCODE, because this would make it possible to set and follow the links while writing the documentation in the editor.

    <Title>New Window Behaviour broke</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0 (1.8.0)
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.2

For me, the last months when working VSCode,
spawning a new window with Shift + CMD + n has openened a new window as a 'tab' above the editor,
but in the same instance.

I found this incredibly useful for working with multiple projects in the same VSCode window.

However, this was removed in 1.8, now a new window is openened.
Was this removed, or can i somehow enable this behaviour again?
I've read through the docs &amp; the settings but couldn't find anything related.

    <Title>Markdown preview rendering width does not consider window.zoomLevel correctly</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0
- OS Version: Linux Mint LMDE2 Cinnamon 64-bit, Cinnamon 3.2

Depending on the value of window.zoomLevel or  on the fly with Ctrl-'+' or Ctrl-'-', the Markdown preview width might not fit within its display area:
- for `"window.zoomLevel": 1`, the lines are visibly shorter than the editor area, and the scroll bar sits left of the right border.
![zoomlevel-up](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5325416/21288703/4075c584-c48a-11e6-8a5e-acbe06a327fe.png)
- for `"window.zoomLevel": 0`, the lines just fill the editor area.
- for `"window.zoomLevel": -1`, the lines are overflowing the editor area, no scroll bar is visible, no horizontal scroll bar is displayed.![zoomlevel-down](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5325416/21288709/585b0060-c48a-11e6-9ffd-b6cb33b3bebc.png)

If `window.zoomLevel` is changed in settings.json during runtime, the scrollbar disapears.

Changing fonts or font sizes does change the effective line breaks, but they still try to fit into the same faulty width.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open any folder in VS code
2. In the File explorer, type any first few characters of folder name. (not in the search box).

Issue:
1. Navigation does not work for typing in folder explorer view

Expectation:
1. It should work as FileExplorer handle the input. Typing few character should navigate to the folder. This would really help a lot. </Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the command palette and start typing or click a line anywhere
2. Blocks either start to flicker (when typing) or are just present

This behavior is particularly visible when using themes. For instance, here's a screenshot using Solarized Dark:

It's also present when using Code's default theme, but a bit more subtle.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. start debugging on a program that has a loop and about 40 lines before and after the loop
2. step through the loop

Observe: the source is always scrolled so that the current line (yellow) stays at the same position vertically.

This is a regression from the stable build.

    <Title>Bug of Intellisense with JavaScript</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0
- OS Version: Windows 10.0.14393

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a project folder and create `func.js`, `main.js`, and `jsconfig.json` in it.

`jsconfig.json`:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES6"
    },
    "file": [
        "func.js"
    ]
}
```
`func.js`:
```javascript
function Test() {
    // ...
}
// ...
Test.a = function() {
    // ...
    var k = require('n');
    // ...
    return 0;
};
// ...
Test.prototype.b = function() {
    // ...
    var k = require('n');
    // ...
    return 1;
};
```
`main.js`:
```javascript
Test.a();
var test = new Test();
test.b();
```
2. Open main.js, and move mouse on `Test` or `a()` at line 1, the ToolTip shows `any`, move mouse on any words, the ToolTip shows the sentence that have `any`. Also autocomplete do not show `a` when I type `Test.` and `b` when I type `test.`.

3. Edit `func.js`, make lines which has `require` as comment, like :
```javascript
function Test() {
    // ...
}
// ...
Test.a = function() {
    // ...
    //var k = require('n');
    // ...
    return 0;
};
// ...
Test.prototype.b = function() {
    // ...
    //var k = require('n');
    // ...
    return 1;
};
```
4. Open main.js, and move mouse on `Test` at line 1 and line 2, the ToolTip shows `function Test(): void`, but move mouse on  `a()` at line 1, the ToolTip still shows `any`, move mouse on any words at line 2 and line 3, the ToolTip shows the sentence that haven't `any`. For example, `test` shows
```javascript
var test: {
    b: () =&gt; number;
}
```
5. Output `Test.a()` can get `0`, `test.b()` can get `1`. At Step 4, Visual Studio Code found the definition of `test.b()` as `Test.prototype.b` (move mouse on `b()` at line 3 and the ToolTip shows `(property) Test.b: () =&gt; number`), but not found the definition of `Test.a()` because move mouse on `a()` at line 1 and the ToolTip shows `any`. Also autocomplete show `b` when I type `test.`, but not show `a` when I type `Test.`.

Conclusion:
If the definition of the method or prototype of function in JavaScript have method `require()` in it, Intellisense in Visual Studio Code cannot find the definition of "that function, the prototype of that function, and the method of that function" at another JS file.
If the definition of the method or prototype of function in JavaScript do not have method `require()` in it, Intellisense in Visual Studio Code can find the definition of "that function, and the prototype of that function" at another JS file, but still cannot find the definition of method of that function at another JS file.</Description>

    <Title>Question: How do I remove `Microsoft` folder from my `$HOME`?</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

Every time I start vscode this directory structure is being created inside my home folder:
```
~/Microsoft $ tree
.
└── TypeScript
    ├── node_modules
    │   └── types-registry
    │       ├── index.json
    │       ├── package.json
    │       └── README.md
    └── package.json

3 directories, 4 files
```

How do I change it's path, so it will be created somewhere else, or how do I prevent it from being created at all?
It ruins alignment of my other folders inside $HOME, and makes me feel uneasy.

Steps to Reproduce:
I just updated to the latest version of vscode (1.8) today.

When I formatted (Alt + Shift + F) code for a .html page,
the results were **unexpected**, not properly aligned, and 
**not** the behavior of code formatting prior to 1.8.

The .html page is a part of an ionic 2 project and so has 
ionic 2 components along with typical html elements such as `&lt;div&gt;`.</Description>

    <Title>Zen mode should center page content or have configurable margins in percent of viewing area</Title>
    <Description>The purpose of Zen mode is to get rid of all distractions and make it easy to read/write/scroll through code (most often a single file). Sadly without centering on large screens the current implementation is not fulfilling that purpose for me. 

It is not adding a margin or centering the defined number of columns on screen or inside the tab area thus I have to constantly turn my head left to read. 

On my 30 Inch main monitor this is how zen mode can be configured to look in Sublime:

Zen mode is in! I love you guys, thanks for that, been looking forward to it! However, everything tends to hang to the left super heavily, which is not so fun in large monitors. Although I bet it works great on a vertical setup:

![VS Code Zen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3832380/21203753/9c834220-c219-11e6-892a-a3c193df2538.png)

I would love it if there were a way to add some left padding of sorts. For now I just turned off the Fullscreen option, changed the background color of my Desktop to match VS Code, and that works to some degree:

Distraction free mode in IntelliJ tries to centre the code a bit:

    <Title>Default new window position and size</Title>
    <Description>When I open a new window in VS Code (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+N), the new window takes about 1/3 of the screen and I need to manually resize it to make it bigger.  (On Windows this may not be a huge issue since there's the maximize button. But on a Mac, laborious manual resizing is needed to keep windows in the same space.)

Wanted behavior: The window is sized and positioned with the size and position taken from the last user-sized and the last user-positioned window.

Possible workaround if this is hard to implement: add an option to specify new default window size and an option to specify a new default window position, both in pixels.

Current behavior when I Ctrl+click the "initHistoryItem" name on line 3: nothing happens.
Expected behavior: VS Code should navigate to the actual static method initHistoryItem on line 5.

Similar problem, when I click on line 3 on the History name, VS navigates to strange definition in lib.es6.d.ts instead of focusing the current class name on line 1.

```
class History {
    search(items) {
        var urls = items.map(History.initHistoryItem); // &lt;-- ctrl+click here
    };
    static initHistoryItem(hi) {
        hi.info = new URL(hi.url);
        return hi;

    <Title>Show search results "incrementally" while searching</Title>
    <Description>### Feature request

Current behavior: vscode currently gathers all search results and when the search is fully complete, the UI is updated with all the results.

Desired behavior: I wish that vscode would update the UI while searching with results that have thus far been found. In my opinion this is a much nicer user experience, especially in larger projects where full project searches can take up a long time to complete. If the desired result is found early in the search, the user should be able to select the result and jump to the code (the search should just keep going until it is completed, or if the user aborts it).

    <Title>Customize peek</Title>
    <Description>It's more of a feature request. I am referring to the peek display zone (the one on blue background).
It's quite a great thing, but it's annoying that uses all the horizontal space. 
In my case I like to use the right side where there is a lot of empty space (no code) to display something. And keep the code from the current file visible and unchanged (when peek is used it shifts the code a few lines lower.  
It would be great if we could change its size and even position anywhere. That way we can see both the peek version and the current file however we like.

}
```

2. This works ok: put cusror at `3:11`

    <Title>Feature Request: Git Diff/Undo from gutter</Title>
    <Description>Hello

vscode 1.7.2

VSCode displays changed lines in the gutter. However to 'undo' a change, we have to first stage all the changes we want, and then undo whatever is left.

However this requires many clicks and context changes.
1. Git  
2. Diff   
3. Click Lines you want to keep  
4. Click undo on non-stages lines   

In Visual Studio I have an extension that allows me to undo lines/hunks by clicking that git gutter decoration:

![diff margin example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5593825/21073237/066e5ccc-bed9-11e6-867f-22029b887a93.gif)

I do not think it is possible to create a similar extension because there is no public api to hook the click event. So I am requesting it either be integrated into VS, or expose click events as an API.</Description>

    <Description>Hi,

- VSCode Version: 1.7.2
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y wget curl build-essential libx11-dev git

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | bash -

```

as root in a Ubuntu 14.04 Travis CI build instance. You'll get the error documented [here](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/Code-OSS.AppImage/builds/182812418). Most importantly I get the message:

    <Title>Deleted files show up in quick open if they were deleted when vscode was closed with the file not open</Title>
    <Description>One case from #14761:

- Open folder A
- Create a file 'foo.txt'
- Close the tab (ie cmd+w)
- Quit vscode
- Delete foo.txt
- Reopen folder A in vscode
- See that foo.txt is in quick open. If I try to open it, I get an error message

If foo.txt was open when I quit vscode, this doesn't repro (due to looking for it when vscode opens?) If I delete the file when vscode is open, this doesn't repro. I see this on MacOS and Windows.</Description>

    <Title>[macOS] Properly handle Window Restoration during Sudden Termination (for Spaces)</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.7.2 (7ba55c5860b152d999dda59393ca3ebeb1b5c85f, 2016-11-21T22:01:10.756Z)

---

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. [Create multiple Spaces](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21872) for the current User.
2. Open Visual Studio Code on macOS (any version 10.7+).
3. Open a Folder (or new window) multiple times: once, at least, in each Space you created in Step 1.
    - Ensure you have the `window.reopenFolders` [setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_window-management) set to `all`.
4. Perform one of the following [_Sudden Termination_](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/CoreAppDesign/CoreAppDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010543-CH3-SW22) actions:
    1. **Logout** of the current User. Log back into the same user.
    2. **Shut Down** the computer. Turn the computer back on.
    3. **Restart** the computer.

### Expected Results:

Visual Studio Code's windows restore to the Spaces they were in when the action in Step 4 took place.

### Actual Results:

Visual Studio Code restores all windows to the current Space (typically "Desktop 1") when the user is properly logged back in. They must be manually reassigned to the previous spaces.

### Errata:

- Compare Visual Studio Code's results with that of Apple's built-in applications: all windows of Apple-built apps correctly restore to the Space they existed in prior to the `Sudden Termination` event.
- Apple _does_ offer the ability to [**Assign apps to Spaces**](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21872). However, this only adjusts what Space the Windows start in. If a user intentionally moves the windows to different Spaces then all Windows would recollect to _that_ space upon restart instead of the previously assigned Space (as expected). In short, this is not a solution to the problem.
- **Use Case:** A developer creates three Spaces and opens a folder in a unique Visual Studio Code window on each Space. These Spaces serve different development contexts for the developer. When restarting (say from OS update), the developer expects the windows to restore to the previously used Space.
- According to _Apple Developer Relations_, apps that wish to support this feature must "use NSWindow’s [encodeRestorableStateWithCoder:](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsresponder/1526236-encoderestorablestatewithcoder) and [restoreStateWithCoder:](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsresponder/1526253-restorestatewithcoder)" (those APIs are part of [NSResponder](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsresponder)). This is also somewhat outlined [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/CoreAppDesign/CoreAppDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010543-CH3-SW26).</Description>

    <Title>Changing a selection to the end or beginning of a line while selecting multiple lines behaves wrong</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider 40243d1e01f426f54670f3dbaa6b77d18469310d
- OS Version: macOS 10.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a file with multiple lines of text (for simplicity assume 2 lines of text in here)
2. Place cursor in the middle of line 1
3. Start selection with Shift + Down (now the text from the start column, line 1 until start column, line 2 is selected, which is as intended)
4. Now change the selection to the start of line with Cmd + Shift + Left
5. Selection now goes from start column, line 1 to column 1, line 1 (expected selection: start column, line 1 to column 1, line 2)

This gif should clarify the problem:

Here is the selection I would expect:

This problem appears in different scenarios based on if you started your selection upwards or downwards and if you want to change the selection to the start or the end of a line.</Description>

    <Title>Feature Request: API: Subscribe to the "data" event on a terminal</Title>
    <Description>Hi everybody,

I suggest to add a new function `on` to the class `Terminal`.

## Motivation
There is an extension for Rust [RustyCode](https://github.com/saviorisdead/RustyCode).
There is a command **build**.
When build is finished, we parse output and show warnings, errors and etc. in user's code.
Currently it is made via the class `OutputChannel`, which doesn't support input.

## Example
```typescript
let terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal('Build');
terminal.on('data', data =&gt; {
    let buildProgress = this.parseBuildProgress(data);
    this.updateBuildProgress(buildProgress);
});
terminal.show();
terminal.sendText('make');
```

## Alternatives
### Write to a file
```typescript
let terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal('Build');
terminal.show();
terminal.sendText('make |&amp; tee /tmp/some_file');
```

I will implement it myself.
I am opening this issue to receive opinions.

    <Title>Per language settings are needed</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.2
- OS Version: Win10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a Markdown file and begin writing an article.
2. Code begins offering text suggestions which get in the way of writing.

For example, I type 'te' and it suggest 'test' and 'testing' and if I try to hit enter because I'm at the end of the line and want to go to the next line, Code enters a word I didn't want.

Basically I want to turn off autocomplete for markdown, which would be easy if I could specify settings on a per language basis that override the system defaults.

    <Title>Zooming UI </Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0 - insider
- OS Version: Windows


-- Sorry for the English, I used Google Translator --

Based on issue #14979 with  [comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14979#issuecomment-259390808).


1- Ctrl + + It should zoom in on the editor, the file we're moving, not the zoom of the whole program.
2- Ctrl + - You should zoom out within the editor, the file you are moving, not the zoom of the entire program.
3- Ctrl + 0 You should zoom back to the default, the file you are moving, not the zoom of the entire program.

4- Ctr + +, Ctr + - should work the same way when we use "editor.mouseWheelZoom", by only zooming the file. And using Ctrl + 0 returns to the default.

5- Ctr + = You should do nothing. The zoom continues. You must unlink this function.
6- Ctrl + 0 of the non-numeric keyboard does not reset the zoom.


These shortcut keys should be valid for both numeric and non-numeric keys. In the menu you should change the registration `Ctr + =` by `Ctrl + +`


Why not set specific sizes for the UI? Maybe some [problems ](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14979#issuecomment-265772474)mentioned by @alexandrudima would decrease!!

&gt;In fact I am 100% in favor of eliminating the entire UI zoom we're shipping with, it causes many issues with font anti-aliasing for example and I have to maintain extraneous code to work around it (i.e. not using translate3d when the UI zoom is not 100%)



Example: Small, Normal, Large, Extra large. To set proportions, do a search with someone who uses sizes other than their normal size.</Description>

Menu items should get greyed out if they are are no longer applicable. E.g. Undo/Redo commands should not be displayed if we are at the bottom/top of the undo stack. Same with back/forward. In the cases below, "back" and "redo" both appear to be valid commands, even though they won't do anything.

Hi, since WSL is now available to provide easier access to multiple command line utilities that were normally only available as workaround for windows, is there a possibility to allow VSCode to access the git executable installed on Bash instead of either being forced to maintain two git updated with ssh keys or start vscode from the bash command line (which is currently not supported but would completely solve this issue)

    <Title>[Feature] Copy entire output from Debug Console</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: **1.7.2**
- OS Version: **Windows**

Steps to Reproduce:

*  Try `Ctrl-A` so you can select everything to copy, 
*  Or try highlighting and scrolling in the Debug Console output to get everything.

Either situation *won't* work you can only select by highlighting text that's currently visible within the Output window in the debug console. Ctrl-A (select all) doesn't work in the debug window for some reason either.

It'd be great to be able to either have a button, or just be able to do Ctrl-A (whichever) so you could copy/paste and look through some large output that came out.

When tabbing through the debug viewlet there are a few issues:

- The dropdown and button only take a single tab index
- Interacting with it via enter does nothing
- The focus for this single element is not visible

As part of this I recommend making `.start-debug` a styled `button`.</Description>

    <Title>Preview activity bar icon reordering during drag operation (and let me be sloppy)</Title>
    <Description>Testing #16326

To reorder icons in the activity bar, I have to drag and drop the icon directly on the position I would like it to occupy.  I can't drop it between two icons and have it position between them.

This is generally OK, but when I want to put an icon at the bottom of the list I really just want to be sloppy and drag it to the bottom/empty area of the activity bar. I don't want to have to be accurate and drop it in the last position (the horror of having to be accurate!!)

It would be ideal if when i dragged the icon up or down you could see the other icons move around and almost preview what the activity bar will look like when it is dropped.</Description>

    <Title>Watermarks should automatically hide when panel opened</Title>
    <Description>Refs #16560 

Open the panel, notice how the watermarks are pushing out the logo -&gt; looks a bit broken
Users that know how to open the panel are advanced users and we they do not need watermark help imho. Thus we could automatically hide the watermark if panel is opened.

    <Description>Testing #16026

Have the following compound configuration in [launch.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json) in VSCode repo

```
"compounds": [
		{
			"name": "Debug VSCode",
			"configurations": [
				"Launch VSCode",
				"Attach to Extension Host"
			]
		}
	]
```

- Start the above compound config
- Switch between two configurations in the launch widget

This will mess up the widget and there is no way to terminate it.

    <Title>Allow extensions to have visibility into the user's build command</Title>
    <Description>This feature request is required in order for IncrediBuild to be able to offer in its extension for VS Code the level of user experience we offer in Visual Studio.

IncrediBuild is the de-facto Visual Studio C++ \ XBox \ Android NDK **build acceleration** installed on more than 100,000 machines worldwide and as part of a partnership we've done with MS, IncrediBuild is offered as a freemium version as part of the VS2015 and soon VS2017 (any VS user can access IncrediBuild directly from within VS).

IncrediBuild is also used to accelerate a variety of compilers and build tools such as Make, Scons, ninja, Jom, Jam and many others.
 
IncrediBuild offers an extension inside IDEs allowing users to execute their builds in a distributed manner, seamlessly harnessing hundreds of idle CPUs they already own across their local network or public cloud to highly accelerate compilations \ tests \ code generation and any other compute intense process.
IncrediBuild effectively transforms the developer's 8 cores laptop into a virtual super computer with hundreds of cores and gigs of memory.

In order for IncrediBuild's VS Code extension to offer users the same seamless integration as offered in Visual Studio, we need to get as an input the build command that the user executes when compiling his project.
 
We can call VS Code's API function executeCommand to execute the 'workbench.action.tasks.build' command to build the project, however, we didn't find a way to have VS Code translate the command name to the full command line for IncrediBuild to execute.
 
We seek a way to convert the 'workbench.action.tasks.build' command to a full command line which we can feed to BuildConsole or any other way to get the full build command line to execute.

I would like to see a "Save All" shortcut button combo. I am usually editing and writing different files in the same project and I wish to edit like for example 5-6 files and then have a shortcut key combo that will Save All of the files at once. I don't know if this will be easy to implement since Ctrl-Shift-S is already "Save As". Its not a high priority, its just something that I would want as an easy way o save the whole project with my keyboard.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a Folder with several .md files
2. Open a few of the .md files
3. click Open Preview to view the rendered markdown

The preview shown often does not match the file that was active when the Open preview command was invoked.

I've never changed settings explicitly. But here are the files:

user settings.json:
```json
{
    "git.confirmSync": false
}
```
workspace settings.json:
```json
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.
{

The names for the parentheses on the first line in the TextMate grammar file are defined as: `meta.keyword.bug.parantheses.[...]` and on the second line broken's metabug's name is defined as `meta.keyword.bug.parameter.metabug`.

On all themes included with Visual Studio Code by default don't specify anything about `meta.keyword[...]`, so it shouldn't be highlighted. (Dark+ theme is being used on the screenshot)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use the following tasks.json:

```
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "cmd",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "showOutput": "always",

            "problemMatcher": "$tsc"
        },
        {
            "taskName": "tslint",
            "suppressTaskName": true,
            "isBuildCommand": true,
            "args": [
                "tslint src/**/*.ts{,x} test/**/*.ts{,x} --project tsconfig.json"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": {
                "owner": "tslint",
                "fileLocation": [
                    "relative",
                    "${workspaceRoot}"
                ],
                "severity": "warning",
                "pattern": {
                    "regexp": "^(\\S.*)\\[(\\d+), (\\d+)\\]:\\s+(.*)",
                    "file": 1,
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 3,

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Do ctrl+shift+b

3. Depending on the order of the tasks I just see errors (tsc) or warning (tslint)

Steps to Reproduce (intermittent):

I have not figured out what steps exactly causing issue to happen, but I encounter it 5-6 times a day.

1. set user preferences: "editor.tabSize": 2,
2. unknown action
3. auto format file
4. file will be formatted with 4 spaces instead of 2

Observations: 
- issue happens on single file, other opened files are not affected
- pressing TAB creates correct (2 spaces) indentation
- closing file doesnt fix it, only closing whole studio</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. on a mac switch to the greek keyboard
2. press the two-key combination to produce the accented version of any vowel of the greek alphabet (e.g. ά, έ, ί, ό, ή, ύ, ώ)
3. you get the expected accented character
4. now press any other character or space
5. you get another copy of the accented character, followed by the character you just entered

This behaviour first appeared very recently (no more than a week, I would say) and renders VS Code nearly unusable. I'll try to check if it is also happens on Windows.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set keyboard to Dvorak layout. In this layout the key marked "{" is now the "/" which is used for commenting.
2. Try to comment with the key marked "{" on the layout. It instead indents left as should be done on a US layout. 
3. Changing it does not work because in the editor pressing the pressing the key marked "{" produces "/" as it should according to the dvorak layout. 


To clarify: The dvorak keyboard layout works correctly in the editor. But not when using shortcuts. And the shortcuts cannot be re-mapped because its tied to the editor. </Description>

The contents displayed in the HTML preview tab window gets reloaded when tabbing off and back to the preview tab window.

Is there a way this can be avoided. 
I'm using the HTML preview window to display custom content in two separate extensions:   
- [Python](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode)  
    + Displaying results from Jupyter kernel
- [Git History](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/gitHistoryVSCode/issues/51)  
    + Displaying Git log 

As you can imagine this doesn't produce the best UX (https://github.com/DonJayamanne/gitHistoryVSCode/issues/51).</Description>

`+config` and `shared` folder are on the same level as other files (app.component.* files). But when we look at it (`ignoring the right arrow beside folder name`) it seems the `app.component.*` files are inside `shared` folder.

- Open some file `a.ts`
- Put the cursor on a reference to something that is defined in `a.ts`
- Do 'go to definition'
- Do 'back'

This error seems to appears on VSCode Insiders only, VSCode 1.7.2 does not reproduce this behaviour.

I have a French Keyboard, mapped with `U.S International - PC`.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Begin typing an accent (e.g. `Alt` + `E` to begin a acute)
2. Type the letter you want to put accent on
3. Type a next character
4. Accented letter is now duplicated.

&gt; This does not happen when using the macOS accented letters box by pressing the letter during a certain time. But it's slower.

    <Title>Turn on ```editor.formatOnType``` for a particular language</Title>
    <Description>For the [Python](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode) extension I have a custom [OnTypeFormattingEditProvider](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/blob/master/src/client/typeFormatters/blockFormatProvider.ts) that ensures certain blocks of code are properly indented.

For instance if the user were to type the following code in Python:  
```python
if x == y:
    print(x)
    else:
```
After typing in the text ```print(x)``` at line 2, the user hits enter:  
- The cursor at this point will be indented and positioned under the letter ```p```   
- Then types the string ```else:```

In Python the position of ```else:``` is incorrect. It needs to be at the same indentation level as the corresponding ```if```.  This is where the OnTypeFormattingEditProvider comes in, it will automatically format that line (by removing the unnecessary white space).

It works as expected.

However, Python users will have to manually turn on the setting ```editor.formatOnType``` in their user or workspace settings. 

**I.e. almost everyone using this extension will miss out on this (very useful and crucial) feature.**  

- Is there a way for the extension to turn this on as a default value?  
I know I could manually alter the ```enditor.formatOnType``` value via code. Is that the right approach? Would that not affect other languages as well?  
- Or is there a way to turn this on for a specific language, ```Python``` in this case?

    <Title>Better indicator of overflow in editor's tab bar</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Os X 10.11.6

See image.  There is no visual indicator of the overflow.  It is not clear that there are more open editors.  Only once moused over does  the tab bar have  a scrollbar (it was moused over as I was taking the screenshot).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open DEBUG CONSOLE to debug javascript files
2. Press ENTER key

Enter key should not trigger if there is no value input, scrolling to bottom of console should be good behavior since I have to drag my mouse to bottom of the window in order to see the latest information, not automatically :(</Description>

    <Title>Too easy to mistakenly move files</Title>
    <Description>Does anyone else find it's way too easy to mistakenly drag and drop files into new folders?

Please excuse if you don't. But I've found it's very easy to move files by mistake when working on big projects and can be a nightmare trying to find where you dropped the file if, especially in a large file tree structure.

Again, this might be me and my clumsy hands so apologies, but I think it would be awesome to at least turn on an option to confirm file drag and drops. That way people who don't care for the feature wouldn't have it foisted on them.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a couple of projects.

3. Can you quickly understand which button corresponds to which project?

You can't. Because the title has the current file name first, not the project name.

&lt;sub&gt;It'd be funny if VSCode used favicons for the taskbar buttons... :)&lt;/sub&gt;

    <Title>Cannot browse extensions gallery behind corporate proxy</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 Build 14393

This is another issue related to access the extensions gallery behind a proxy. I read all previous post here and on the web but I was not able to find a fix for my environment.

I tried to setup proxy in settings without authorization
```
    "http.proxy": "http://proxy_address:8080",
    "https.proxy": "http://proxy_address:8080",
    "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
```
and I tried also with authorization, that is usually required by our corporate proxy (BlueCoat)
```
    "http.proxy": "http://domain%5Cusername:password@proxy_address:8080",
    "https.proxy": "http://domain%5Cusername:password@proxy_address:8080",        
    "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
```
In both in this case the error message : **Error read ECONNRESET**

The very strange thing is that with Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise I can browser the extensions.
I decide so to monitor the HTTP traffic using WireShark but I was not able to find the differences the two call looks very similar but in case of VS Code the connection is dropped, in the other case it works.

I checked the two destination addresses and I can open both in HTTPS without problem with the browser on the same machine.

    <Title>Markdown Preview only is display on the part of workspace</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.7.1 (02611b40b24c9df2726ad8b33f5ef5f67ac30b44, 2016-11-03T13:53:14.822Z)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. When I use  **VSCode** for **Preview function of Markdown** , as the picture shows, the result of Preview only is display on **the part of workspace**.

This is my “**Workspace settings**“. Because I just install VSCode and install "Instant Markdown" and "Markdown Theme Kit" plug-in. Beside, I try to reinstall VSCode and remove ".vscode" folder in current user directory.It likes water off a duck's back.
```
{
    // "markdown.styles": [
    //     ""
    // ]
    "window.zoomLevel": 1
}
```
2. I have use **Debugger for Chrome** plugin for a demo project which only include a html file. There exist some errors.
This is showed in the **console of Chrome**.
```
&gt;Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
&gt;Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```
This is showed in the **console of VSCode**.
```

Did I miss something on the changelog? I just updated it and suddenly it stops working. Running with `--disable-extension` still does not fix the problem. Apparently no issue about this has been raised in here so I'm quite confused right now whether it's an intended change or a local problem. Thanks.

    <Title>[Ctrl]+[D] adjacent text extends selection instead of selecting seperately</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type `aaaaa`
2. Select the first character
3. Press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;D&lt;/kbd&gt; several times

Expected Behaviour:

- The editor will select the following occurrences of `a` until all individual `a`'s are selected.

Actual Behaviour:

- The editor adds the following `a` to the current selection on each time that &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;D&lt;/kbd&gt; is pressed. **This means that the second time, you are not selecting the next occurrence `a` but `aa` and the third time you are adding `aaaa` to your selection**

This is important. A common use case would be when you want to change the characters individually, or when you want to add characters _in between_ them.

With Sublime, you can select all the characters (individually) as expected:

With VS Code, you can't even select them all, and it's one long selection (rather than several distinct ones):

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1

Steps to Reproduce:

3. Zoom editor view (Ctrl++)

Result:
Annotations appear off to the left in the margin, instead of at the proper locations. They're still clickable out there, so it's functional.

The recently opened file list in the pallet includes deleted files.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to be going away.  An aggravating factor may be that I sometimes mistakenly select one (confusing it for one of the valid files) which seems to erroneously promote it's ranking in the "recently opened files".

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a file in a project
2. Delete the file (in my case, I tend to delete on the command line, not inside of vscode)
3. In Pallet, start typing the name of a similarly named file.  The deleted file will present itself in the "recently opened" section of the drop down list.</Description>

    <Title>Create file and nested directories at once</Title>
    <Description>It would be great, if you could create number of nested directories specifying their names separated with slashes in the dialog that opens while creating new file.

For example if you create file entering following string into dialog: `/app/some/module/api.ts`
It should create folder structure like this:
```
app/
  some/
    module/
      api.ts
```

If `some` folder  already exists, it should just create subfolder `module` into it and put `api.ts` file into it.</Description>

    <Title>Reopen files after a restart (same as for "window.reopenFolders")</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open some files. Not a folder. Just some plain source code files (`Ctrl + O`)
2. Make some changes with them. Save. Don't close files. Close the editor.
3. Open the editor and observe one brand new `Untitled-1` tab only. But where are my previous files? Why were not they opened?

There is a `window.reopenFolders` option. Ok, it is not a bad option. But how about files? How about those devs who do not use folders? I never open folders. Lack of this feature in VSCode is annoying. ST3 has it so I'm compelled to use it.

    <Title>Display gitignored files/folders in gray (inactive) color (in left explorer tree)</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

Even that GIT integration is good in @code but in explorer it's not possible to see which **files are marked as ignored** and will not be pushed to git.
In other editors these ignored files are **displayed in gray** - so you know which are not relevant to edit (eg. some generated files, configs etc).

Probably best would be if icon themes for explorer will have ability to change look of this feature.

1. Divider symbol "/" and regex string symbol "/" is somehow conflicting with each other and causes wrong coloring and syntax highlighting errors. But the code is working perfectly, and this issue only happens on Visual Code.
2. The code is attached below:
`$scope.formatPrice = function(num) {
        if (num &gt;= 1000000) {
            return (num / 1000000).toFixed(1).replace(/\.0$/, '') + 'M';
        }
        if (num &gt;= 1000) {
            return (num / 1000).toFixed(1).replace(/\.0$/, '') + 'K';
        }
        return num;

Although this may be by design, it is different behavior compared to Visual Studio and other editors I have used. I typed a lot of code into a js file and when I renamed it prior to saving it, it wiped out all my code. It happened to me a couple times and now that I understand what is happening I'll be more careful in the future, but it would be nice if behavior didn't occur.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a js file and type code in it
2. Before saving, rename the file
3. Acknowledge the prompt</Description>

- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6 (15G1108)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In a .html file open a custom tag
2. Try to close that tag with the autocomplate functionality of VS Code (Ctrl + Space &gt; Tab)
3. The closing tag is in all lower case letters and ignores the casing of the original opening tag

Example:
input:

`&lt;TestTag&gt;`

-write `&lt;`
- press "Ctrl + Space"
- press "Tab" to autocomplate the closing tag

output (result):
`&lt;TestTag&gt;&lt;/testtag&gt;`

In the previous 1.6.x version this used to work as expected leading to an output of 
`&lt;TestTest&gt;&lt;/TestTest&gt;` 

Is this a bug or a feature and if so how can I revert/fix it.

Opening a folder seems to work around the problem

1. Open Folder
2. Editors show up and life continues as usual
3. Close Folder
4. No editors show up again

Yesterday I added this to my user settings file:

```
"files.hotExit": true,
```

However, removing that does not seem to fix the problem.

On the plus side, hot exit seems to work when the folder is loaded.</Description>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a new file and type `112233445566` into it.
2. Open the find dialog and enable regex search.
3. Type `\d\d` into the search box.
4. Notice there is correctly 6 matches and hitting enter cycles through them.
5. Hit option+enter with the intention of placing 6 cursors - one on each match: `11`, `22`, `33`, `44`, `55`, `66`
6. Notice you only get 3 cursors - one on `1122` one on `3344` and one on `5566`

    <Title>Very high CPU + memory usage by "watcherService" service process + possible cause</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04.1 64bit

There have been some (unresolved) reports about high CPU load: #14222 #10439

I'm experiencing a similar high load on Ubuntu. It's always the "--type=watcherService" process. It even happens with --extensions-disabled

top output:
```
  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND     
29275 ivo       20   0 2546512 1,579g  33836 R 115,3 10,1   2:36.30 code  
```

ps output:
```
ivo      29275  115 10.1 2588532 1667120 ?     Rl   16:40   3:06 /usr/share/code/code /usr/share/code/resources/app/out/bootstrap --type=watcherService
```

When `strace`-ing the process I noticed the following output:

```
(lots of)
futex(0x7f7c4ef2c9e0, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1
futex(0x7f7c4ef2ca0c, FUTEX_WAKE_OP_PRIVATE, 1, 1, 0x7f7c4ef2ca08, {FUTEX_OP_SET, 0, FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT, 1}) = 1
futex(0x7f7c4ef2c9e0, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1
(and then)
inotify_add_watch(35, "/home/ivo/m3r/projects/Guts/viscera/tmp/broccoli_merge_trees-output_path-rsLThmVz.tmp/modules/ember-getowner-polyfill", IN_MODIFY|IN_ATTRIB|IN_MOVED_FROM|IN_MOVED_TO|IN_CREATE|IN_DELETE|IN_DELETE_SELF|IN_MOVE_SELF) = 68357
```

Specifically the `inotify_add_watch` on some file in tmp/ which was loaded with (old) files caught my attention. There's no need to watch these files and watching all of them could very well cause the problem.

After removing tmp/ entirely the problem disappeared. After filling tmp/ again with about 20 copies of itself (resulting in appr. 400.000 files), the problem reappeared. And after removing the issue is gone again.

This happens even with 

```
    "files.exclude": {
        "tmp/": true
    }
```

Conclusion: could it be the watcherService ignores `files.exclude` and tmp/ folders in general and will happily attempt to monitor 400K+ files?

Any idea why there seems to be a strange block highlight in the editor? I've tried reinstalling it, changing the theme and I've removed all the extensions, but I'm still experiencing this issue.

    <Title>Add editor action copySelection[Up/Down]</Title>
    <Description>An action like `editor.action.copySelectionUpAction` and `editor.action.copySelectionDownAction` additional to `editor.action.copyLinesUpAction` and `editor.action.copyLinesDownAction` would make code copying even better.

E.g. you have the following code

```javascript
var user = [
    {
        name: 'Andy',
        age: 25
    }, 
    {
        name: 'Bob',
        age: 19
    }
];
```

Now I want to add some more users by copying the last user Object and editing the values.
I select the last Object with `SHIFT` + `UP` including the comma, but without the closing bracket.

```javascript
    , 
    {
        name: 'Bob',
        age: 19
    }
```

With  `editor.action.copyLinesDownAction` the whole line including the previous closing bracket is copied.
A new editor action  `editor.action.copySelectionDownAction`  would solve this.</Description>

    <Description>To restore an untitled file from a backup we currently just do this:

`this.textFileService.resolveTextContent(this.restoreResource)`

That however will take the configured workspace encoding (which can easily be UTF-16) and thus might cause a corrupt content to return. 

I suggest to use the same options as for restoring files.

    <Title>Wrong Comment Syntax for TSX/JSX</Title>
    <Description>From @daslicht on Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage#355
When we open a ```*.tsx``` file,  VS Code shows TypeScript React in the bottom right corner.

If we now  highlight some text and call the comment shortcut, the block should be wrapped into the following:
```
	{/* ... */}
```

Currently there are just ```//``` inserted, which is wrong

    <Title>Integrated Terminal with git-bash sometimes drops letters</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider 
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

When typing out commands using the integrated terminal using git-bash ("terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"), sometimes letters aren't included in the actual command even though they're on the screen. I'm unable to reproduce it every time, but it usually occurs when I press backspace quickly and retype something. I'm running windows in a VM on macOS if that matters. In the first screenshot it dropped the 'a' from 'auth' and in the second screenshot it dropped the 'u' from 'checkout'

I'm coming from PyCharm and am used to working without tabs and the sidebar. In PyCharm i can limit it so when i open one document the other document previously opened gets closed (But it doesn't prompt to save any changes as these persist, not sure how though, and remain there when i re-open).

Is there something similar for VS Code?

## Expected behaviour:
The space on the right and on the bottom of the preview tab should be used as well. The blue selection should cover the entire white space.

This happens whenever the previewHtml command is used, not only when previewing markdown.</Description>

1. Open Explorer side panel
2. Double click on panel right edge
3. Repeat step 2

It would make sense for panel to not obstruct tabs and be just above the variables tab and below launch.

I have to move that panel every now and then to access other tabs via mouse. The usability could be improved.

My vscode is in an 'update loop'.
When i start it it asks for my password to "add a new helper tool".
I put my password, then vscode tells me it s ready to update.
I choose "Update now" then Vscode closes itself, but does not restart.
Once i launch it again, the same process starts over.

I tried download vscode insider again but same issue.

NOTE, sublime has NO TROUBLE traversing the symlink
I REALLY HOPE that MS does not give us the usual BS answer that it can't be done.
This is one of the most wonderful products out there.  I would hate to have to regress to sublime because I can not work in my clients secure work environment.

In a command window if I run `code .` it opens code fullscreen (which I want; it's how I left it). If I then run `code .` again from another command window, it opens in a small window (not full screen).

This is 100% reproducible for me. It's incredibly minor, but it is a little annoying (it's an extra step to maximise every time I do it) and it does feel a bit wonky.</Description>

    <Description>starting in v.1.7.1 auto format is going crazy. This happens after the editor has been open for some time. 

With the settings as spaces,2 it always formats as spaces,4. Restarting fixes the issue and code identifies that file as spaces,4 (which was never manually set) and changing it back now works again.

    <Title>Relative path to workspace in title bar</Title>
    <Description>Since a few days it seems to be possible to show the full path in the title bar in the insider builds.  
This is already really helpful when figuring out where I am currently at in my codebase but most of the times the full path seems to be too much information in my opinion. A solution to this problem could be another option to only show the path starting from the workspace directory.

Example: I have a folder called `my-app` which is located in the folder `~/Development`. When I open a file located in `src/foo/bar/index.js` for example, I can either display the full path (`~/Development/my-app/src/foo/bar/index.js`) or just the filename (`index.js`).  
With the proposed addition the title could be reduced to `src/foo/bar/index.js` which in a lot of cases contains the information I am looking for when I look at the path of a file.</Description>

    <Title>Using Windows 7 taskbar popup menu to open recent folder name containing spaces fails probably due to lack of quoting</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1 
- OS Version: Windows 7 x64 Professional N SP 1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a folder containing a space in the name (e.g. "c:\temp\Test Folder")
2. Navigate to that folder in Windows Explorer
3. Right click in explorer to open that folder in VSCode
4. Close VSCode
5. Right click on VSCode icon on taskbar (created by pinning VSCode to taskbar but problem happens from non-pinned icon too).
6. From recent folders select c:\temp\Test Folder (no " characters shown in menu)
7. Instead of opening the folder VSCode opens 2 new files - c:\temp\Test and c:\Windows\system32\Folder

Same problem doesn't happen if:
1. selecting files with spaces in name using taskbar popup menu
2. selecting folder from File/Open Recent... menu inside VSCode
3. selecting folder names without spaces from taskbar popup menu

    <Title>Add function preview summary window to editor</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7.1
- OS Version: Windows 7 Ent

In netbeans, there is an internal panel that will show you all the classes and functions that are found in the file currently with the focus, if you click on the function or the class within the panel, it will take you right to the defining line in the file.
I find this so extremely useful for when you are searching through a file for any given function or just overlooking the file contents. This is an easy way to look at all the classes and their members that have been defined in the file. That for programming languages,
For HTML, CSS for example it will show the file tree and the classes. This a pretty smart file preview.
It'd be nice to have this feature in VSC as well.

2. In the upper left corner, we can see this: undefined

3. However, if I evalute "this", I get the right "this" in the console (as you can see in the above screenshot)

Why the difference between the "this" when I hover it, and when I evaluate it ?

Intermittent issue saving files on a network (samba / cifs) share. This share is between two PC's on the same internal network.

Now and again when saving a file it will pop up an error saying it could not save, it then pops up a notice saying file has changed on disk with option to compare

When comparing the "disk" version is empty. The save has cased saving a blank file.

Closing the file and reopen and I can continue saving and editing as per usual.

    <Title>Console process (yarn install) runs slower then in native console</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6
- OS Version: Windows 10

Noticed that `yarn install` process takes longer time in vscode console. Think this should be investigated.


Can be reproduced this way:

1.  install yarn package manager (`npm i yarn -g`)
2.  create package.json and add two dependencies:
```
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.6.0",
    "babel-preset-stage-0": "^6.5.0"
```
3. run `yarn` in this directory. 

Those modules have many internal dependencies and yarn install (Link dependencies state) takes quite a long time, so it can be compared running in native console and in vscode integrated terminal.

    <Description>VSCode is provided as .deb and .rpm packages for Linux users, but these are only provided as a stand-alone download, rather than from a repository.

Since VSCode updates often, having to manually download the new package and install it every time gets very old very fast. I notice that Windows users do get automatic updates which significantly improves the user experience.

It would be very much appreciated if VSCode updates were provided via repositories, rather than just as stand-alone downloads.

When working with a "high precision" touch pad and using the two finger scroll it doesn't seem as "smooth" in the code editor as it did in previous versions of VS Code. When you first starting moving the fingers it takes a bit of time before it starts moving and then it "jumps". Once the scrolling is activated it is smooth, but once you let go of the fingers on the touch pad and then start again, it again has a delay before the scroll starts.

It should work just as smooth as it does in e.g. Chrome or Edge. This to me was one of the great advantages with VS Code over the full VS, so I am sad that we've lost the smooth scrolling again.

I'm on a Dell XPS15 and the touch pad should be a top-of-the-line touchpad (high precision).</Description>

    <Title>New Typescript grammar has alot of inconsistencies in the Dark+ theme</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.7
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. create a new typescript .ts file.
2. write the text according to the screenshot.

The new Typescript grammar and/or Dark+ theme has alot of inconsistencies.

- Some function calls are green and some are yellow. (I think it's the 'support.class' scope that makes some 'support.function''s green.)
- Some variables are light blue and some are green. (I think it's the 'support.class' scope that makes some 'support.variable''s green.)
- In arrays, constants are uncolored but variables are colored.
- Code inside a Promise has wrong syntax highlighting. For example 'let' is green, and the arrow '=&gt;' is green.
- 'console.log', 'console.dir', etc is completely green, why?
- It's pretty much light blue everywhere, since all variables, parameters, interface keys, variablename.variablename2.variablename3, etc are light blue.
This makes almost all text light blue, which is not an improvement.
It would be better if a base variable is light blue, but all member keys in that base variable are either uncolored or have another color shade.

It would be nice to replicate a feature in the Chrome debugger in the VS Code debugger if possible (it may be a requirement in the Chrome remote debug extension or the Chrome remote debug API, but not sure).

If you are stepping through code and some variables/parameters are set or change value then these values are displayed in a tooltip-like display next to the assignment. This is nice to have as it highlights where things are changing in code and saves having to manually set up watches in a lot of cases.

It's not very efficient to type file name and time once I create a file,
so, is there some ways to do this, like predefined variables.

    <Description>Hi,

I'm looking for an API that would give access to the search results, more specifically the files and line numbers/characters that _where found_. I didn't find anything like this, but instead, just the `vscode.workspace.findFiles` function.

With this in hand, it would be possible to _mark_ each result for further navigation. (Original request from my [Bookmarks extension](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/issues/7))

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a least two editor groups and put the in-product release notes in a right or lower editor group.
2. Close the left or top editor group.

The in-product release notes become blank. Clicking the editor or scrolling has no effect.  Double-clicking the tab heading refreshes the release notes.

It doesn't repro if the release notes are left or above the closing editor group.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Try to change `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` to pass additional parameters like variable expansion flag.
2. terminal fails with exit code 1

There is no current way to pass additional parameters to the Windows shell, it would be useful for configuration scripts and flags passed to the terminal, os other options passed to custom terminals.
In fact, the integrated terminal don't work with anything other than powershell and cmd.</Description>

    <Title>Be able to run code after debugging completes.</Title>
    <Description>This is a feature request. 

I am doing an experiment using VSCode around remote debugging. I use SSH port forwarding to connect to remote debugger (as part of preLaunchTask). It works great. However there is currently no way for me to shutdown the SSH after debugging completes. 

It will be great if there are something like 'postDebugTask' where I can run something to clean things up. This seems to be a common scenario for remote debugging.

Steps to Reproduce:

**The hard way:**
1. Create a folder `abc`
2. Open that folder as a workspace in Code - Insiders
3. Rename the `abc` folder to something else, like `xyz`, while Code is still running
4. Use your favorite method to _crash_ Code in such a way that the `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\Backups\workspaces.json` file doesn't get updated; hard resetting your machine works best! :)
5. After your machine restarts, try to open Code
6. Nothing happens
7. Manually delete or edit the contents of `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\Backups\workspaces.json`
8. Code will start normally

**The easy way:**
1. Close all running instances of _Code - Insiders_
2. Edit the contents of the `workspaces.json` file to point to an inexistent directory, like:
`{"folderWorkspaces":{"c:\\foo\\bar\\baz":[]}}`
3. Try to open Code; it shouldn't start

If I am working on a file and make a change that causes errors in other files I would like to be able to glance over to the Explorer tree and see where the errors are.

Possibly add a red x (or circle) on the file (or parent folder) icon that has the error.

I use "Problems" if there is a large amount of issues or I want to see details.

    <Title>Tabs not rendering right</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tabs
2. Close VSCode
3. Re-open VSCode

Minor issue, I know, but still strange.
Looks like that, when opened, VSCode tries to fit all tabs in the given space.
When I click on one of the unselected tabs, the rendering starts to work and the horizontal scrollbar appears.

VS Code's git push fails with error messages:

Push to repo on the command line with `git push` works. If I rename the key to id_rsa then the push operations work fine

Also, note that Open Recent does not log SAVED files; if you open a file and save it under a new name, the new name isn't recorded in the RECENT list.

    <Description>#14171

Create `app.js`:

``` js
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    console.log(new Date());
}, 1000);
```

Create `.vscode/launch.json`:

``` json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program 1",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.js",
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
        },
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program 2",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.js",

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
1. Set breakpoint in `app.js`, line 2.
2. Press &lt;kbd&gt;F5&lt;/kbd&gt; to start debugging.
3. Press `Stop` to stop one instance.

Line 2 loses its decoration that the app has hit a breakpoint in the surviving instance, although the debug toolbar still indicates that it is running.

Steps to Reproduce:
- in debug console type 'process.env'
- intellisense appears and shows a rather unhelpful "env" suggestion.
- press enter: the "env" suggestion disappears but the evaluate is not triggered
- press enter again: now  'process.env' is evaluated

I would prefer not to see intellisense in this case and have the first enter start the evaluation.

    <Title>Add support for large text files</Title>
    <Description>Now when you open a file that is a bit large you get a message that the file is too large and can't be opened.

Would it be possible to still allow the file to be opened in a "stream mode"? Basically you can disable the syntax highlight (and maybe other features that would be resource intensive to implement on large files) but open and read the file in chunks of data (what's needed to be displayed on screen) and load more as you scroll (up or down)?

It seems as if, at least by default, vscode's integrated terminal has an unlimited buffer. Is this by design, or is there a way to limit this somehow?

I have configured Ubuntu bash to use as integrated terminal in VS Code.
I've noticed it that folders are marked differently from files, as if they are highlighted (selected) with green background but the font color is also some kind of green/blue shade. It is very hard to distinguish what is the name of the folder. 
Same goes for dark or light themes.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create #Region and #EndRegion tags at the same column tab
2. put code between region tags and make sure they line up at the same column tab
3. VSCode does not allow you to expand or collapse code between region tags when the code between the tags line up with the region tags themselves (where as it does allow you to collapse in PowerShell ISE).

Example:

based on the final example in screenshot above, it seems like region tagging isn't even working, and just seems to be working due to VSCode's default settings

    <Title>Invalid Marker Service State issue after compile task</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.1
- OS Version: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro N, 64bit, anniversary update

Im using VS Code for c++ development. I am compiling with a simple makefile using the visual studio command line tool. 
Since the last update, from time to time when executing my build task, I get the error message "Invalid Marker Service State" and the little spinning bar, indicating that a task is in progress, wont stop spinning. As far as I can tell the build task completes normally and my problem matchers seem to catch all problems. Unfortunately I cant tell what exactly triggers this problem, but it happens quite frequently, about every 15 compilations, which has me restarting VS Code to reset the task in progress indicator.

Every time I search for something in my project, the search in files hangs, sometimes longer than 10 minutes. I have tried other editors (Atom and Brackets) on same project and search is not that slow for them.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. press CTRL+Shift+F and type in some text.
2. site back and enjoy your coffee break.

    <Description>Compared to Sublime counterpart, If i write "fma" in VSC to match "fuzzyMatching", no completion is given, the same is for "fuzzymatching".

Am i missing something or fuzzy matching algorithm in VS Code doesn't recognize camel case and middle letters while typing? If so, why?

Thanks

    <Title>Editor doesn't insert white spaces when formatting html files.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.1
- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12

Steps to Reproduce:
1. 
Make sure that you set 
"editor.insertSpaces": true
in your workspace settings
2.
Make sure you are using indentation with spaces and indentation size 2 in my case.
3. 
Try to format html file

Expected result:
Editor should preserve white spaces as tabs.

Result:
Editor converts spaces to tabs. It should not.

Additional comment:
It works fine when saving typescript file for example.
The white spaces are preserved correctly.

    <Title>API Feature Request: Fetch configuration default value</Title>
    <Description>You know how you have your Default Settings file and then your own User Settings file? Whenever you use the API to get configuration values, it pulls it from the User Settings file if it exists there, otherwise it falls back to the Default Settings file.

It would be nice to have the option to specifically pull configuration values from the Default Settings file. The reason is this:

Lets say you have a configuration value that is meant to be a boolean. Some sort of true/false value for your extension. And then someone copies this configuration value over to their User Settings file but they accidentally change it to a string instead of a boolean.

Now in your extension code, you need to obviously do a type check on the fetch configuration value to make sure it's a boolean. If it's not a boolean, you should probably fall back to the default value. But there is no way to fetch the default configuration value from the Default Settings. The only solution for this is to also hardcode your default value within your code and grab it from there.

I can't see a way to grab default values from configuration, so it would be really nice to have this option. Thanks,

A system error occured (EPERM: operation not permitted, utime '/Library/WebServer/Documents/...

I don't have this issue when working on the same folder from another editor like sublime. I have tried to run code as 'admin' and seem to solve the problem... however, I am greeted with a warning message that says it is not recommended to run code as admin. So what do I do?

Same happens for trying to comment CSS within `&lt;style&gt;` tags.

Could possibly be the same for other languages such as PHP within HTML files?

    <Title>No error message on failed plugin update in 1.5.1</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install ESLint plugin https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint (1.0.8 specified as latest version).
2. Note ESLint version at 1.0.7 and there's an update badge and update button for ESLint.
3. Update ESLint plugin and restart.
4. Version of ESLint plugin still at 1.0.7

I would expect VSCode to show a message specifying the min version the plugin supports or at least an error/warning message that the update failed.

After updating to 1.6.1 the plugin updates correctly.

    <Title>extension-specific setting for format on save</Title>
    <Description>Feature Request for the new setting

`
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
`

As user I want to use the new setting not only language-specific (#13547). I want also want to actively set in my workspace settings, which extension should format the content.

Example: I support 2 projects. In one project the required formatting is Javascript Standard format (chenxsan.vscode-standard-format). In my second project the format Javascript Semi Standard (homerjam.vscode-semistandard-format) is used.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML document
2. Type div or something like that, it should appear then the tooltip.

Everything was working quite well before the last update. I'm using the extension _HTML Snippets (0.0.17)_ , but now it doesn't puts first the tooltip to just press tab; now I need to scroll down to find it and press tab to get it close automatically.

It is pissing me off.

    <Title>Select and operate on multiple items in "Explorer" view</Title>
    <Description>Select and operate on multiple items in "Explorer" view while "Explorer" view is focused.

Expected that selection of multiple items behaves the same (or mostly the same) like in popular file-explorers (in e. g. Windows file explorer), where you can select files and folders items using shortcuts described below.

&gt; To simplify the way of explaining, what behavior I am talking about, it is assumed that the initial state is _focused explorer with one selected item in it_. However, the provided explanation is not logically full enough to use it as an algorithm.
1. `Shift + Up` — add to selection 1 item to top from the current_focused_item
2. `Shift + Down` — add to selection 1 item to bottom from the current_focused_item
3. `Shift + Mouse_Click_On_Item_In_Explorer_View` — add to selection all items between 
   - current_focused_item 
   - and that one (inclusive) which have been clicked at the moment of `Mouse_Click_On_Item_In_Explorer_View`. 
4. `Ctrl + Mouse_Click_On_Item_In_Explorer_View` — add to selection item which have been clicked at the moment of `Mouse_Click_On_Item_In_Explorer_View`. 

If item which is added to selection is is a folder-item, then add to selection all of it inner items.

Expected operations to support when multiple items have been selected:

&gt; Higher priority is at the top of the list
1. Drag and drop (to move files to another location)
2. Open (for non-folder items)
3. Delete
4. Copy

Other notes:
To make feature production-ready, it is (of course) needed to implement the corresponding behavior of deselecting items for the case when multiple items have been already selected.

    <Title>Let extensions force change language mode for a file</Title>
    <Description>I'm writing a new extension providing Hack language support. Hack files still have a .php extension, but start with `&lt;?hh` instead of `&lt;?php`. 

I added the following in the "hack" entry in the language contributes section in package.json:

``` json
    "extensions": [ ".php" ],
    "firstLine": "^&lt;\\?hh\\b.*$"
```

However, all .php files in the workspace are still auto-detected as PHP, and the extension providers (registered with `const HACK_MODE: vscode.DocumentFilter = { language: 'hack', scheme: 'file' };`) aren't triggered unless the file mode is manually changed from PHP to Hack.

I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if PHP is still getting a higher precedence. Is there any way for an extension to force this change?

For webapp framework like angular2, a web component is designed to contains multiple files. For example:

mycomponent.ts
mycomponent-template.html
mycomponent-style.css

I hope there is a way to collapse these items together:
mycomponent.ts
   \_mycomponent-template.html
   \_mycomponent-style.css

Just like *.xaml, *.xaml.cs for WPF in Visual Studio

Before VSCode 1.6, the sidebar is collapsed by default. It works fine for smaller display, as well as non-project files. Since 1.6, the sidebar is expanded when VSCode launches.

My user snippet shortcuts are now so buried under other things that they take as much time to find as just typing in the snippet!

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a user code snippet for TypeScript
   "Import Component": {
       "prefix": "ic",
       "body": [
           "import { $2 } from \"$1\";$3"
       ]
   },
2. Now try to use that code snippet in a ts file:

Where is my shortcut?

If you scroll all the way down you can find it near the end of the intellisense list:

Every time I switch tabs on VS Code the content of the tab is being reloaded. It might not be a problem when developing on local machine, but I'm connected to a remote a machine using WinSShFS.

Can I cache the file locally and only access the remote server on save and first load?

1. Connect to a remote linux server using WinSshFS
2. Open  a folder 
3. Open a file and than another file
4. Switch between the tabs

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.0
- OS Version: Mac OS Sierra 10.12
- Plugins: ms-vscode.csharp 1.4.1, EditorConfig.EditorConfig 0.3.3

After upgrading from 1.5.3, Intellisense and Error Detection seem to have stopped working.  I am coding a .NET Core project written in C#.

What happens is that Intellisense and Error Detection show up (i.e. the red squiggly underlines) when I make an edit in my C# file.  However, after a moment, they disappear again and I can't get them to stay visible.

I noticed that JS/Node/Typescript users seem to be having a similar issue, So I will mention that we do have one JS file in this project as well as a `package.json`.  The purpose of this one JS file is to do a cross-platform script that will build the whole project in one go.  Regardless, this issue happens no matter if the JS File is opened or closed in VS Code.

3. Observe you are able to move up and down but the scroll bar doesn't move when you move past the top or bottom suggestion

Note: You are able to scroll with the mouse wheel

I honestly don't remember if this was the case pre-1.6. I thought that it showed all available suggestions in the window and didn't need to scroll.

Clicking the update button doesn't apply the newest extension version (correct, as expected).

The bug is, that the newest update requiring ^1.6.0 should not be available to users of 1.5.3. Or at least a warning should be displayed saying the newest version of the extension is only compatible with newer versions of VSCode.

    <Title>Uninstall extension goes back to previous version</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6
- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6
1. Get Vim extension at 0.3
2. Updating it to 0.3.7
3. Uninstalling it, it goes back to 0.3. Instead should have removed Vim extension altogether.

This is caused by when upgrading packages VSCode doesn't clean up previous versions of the same extension. 

``` bash
Code &gt; ls ~/.vscode/extensions
vscodevim.vim-0.3.0  vscodevim.vim-0.3.7
```

    <Title>Allow to open multiple files from file quick open</Title>
    <Description>When I open Go To File (typically with Ctrl-P), I'm presented with a list of files (fuzzy filtered by the characters I type if applicable). I can arrow through the list and press Enter to open the file.

What I'd like to be able to do is Shift-Arrow to select multiple files and then press Enter to open _all_ of them.

Here's my use case: I want to add code/functionality to an existing file while also adding tests to it's corresponding test file. The code file and test file both have nearly identical names (the test file typically having `.spec` in the file name), and so are conveniently listed at the top of the list when I enter characters into the fuzzy filter. However, since I can only open a single file, I have to repeat the entire process to open both files.

Shift-Arrow selection would eliminate the issue and improve the workflow. (Reusing the existing principles of multi-select, such as discontinuous selection with Ctrl-Space, would be nice, but is not required.)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a JavaScript File
2. Start writing a comment (either single-line with `//` or multi-line with `/*`
3. Type a single quote: `'`

The single quote will be duplicated because of the quote matching feature. This should not happen when writing a comment (so you can write proper english 😄)

I like write markdown files in vscode.  Many files were opened at the same time. But when i click preview current markdown file. It will not preview current one but the last file. I click preview again on current markdown file, then it will preview current markdown file.
It should preview current markdown file everytime in my opinion.
Thank you.

    <Title>Add an option to hide files that are excluded by .gitignore in Explorer</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.6.0
- OS Version: Windows 10 1607

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a folder
2. Go to Explorer

A single source file may have several corresponding generated files. For example, `foo.ts` has `foo.js`, `foo.js.map`, `foo.d.ts`. It would be convenient to hide those files in Explorer, and only show them when user chooses to.

We can use files such as `.gitignore` to determine which file to hide, or use a separate file, such as `.vscignore` in `.vscode` directory.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an HTML file in VSCode

3. Notice the syntax highlighting of any theme, how `app` is one color and `-root` is another color.

Then, if you try to close the file, it will ask if you want to save the file, if you discard the change, sometime it will replace the whole file content with `null`.  Haven't been able to reproduce this one, happened one time when I record the video.

There's no error in the dev console and I disabled all my extension prior of making the reproduction video.

Also in my house, I've been working with plantuml, and that plugin (I don't remember the name of the plugin) uses the same shortcut that markdown to do the preview, and when I've been doing something with plantuml, the shortcut doesn't work, because vscode always launch the markdown preview.

Previously, while editing JS code in an .html file, it was possible to use the CMD /  keyboard shortcut to comment a line or block of JS code.  Now, it is broken and it inserts HTML comments instead of JS comments.

This is a problem working with Polymer components, because JS and HTML are heavily intermixed in the same .html file.

`&lt;fieldset&gt;\s*&lt;legend&gt;` finds no matches but it should. `&lt;fieldset&gt;$^\s*&lt;legend&gt;` and `&lt;fieldset&gt;\n\s*&lt;legend&gt;` both work.

    <Title>Find and Replace dialog covers content</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Win 10 1607

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have content as long as the window is wide in the first three lines of the window
2. Display the Find and Replace dialog

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1189638/19198376/b739d95c-8c73-11e6-9e0d-e9b0a6335cbb.png)

In some cases, like mine above, this dialog covers the content and there's no way to change that except to make changes to the content itself by adding additional empty lines at the top.

Scrolling doesn't work and neither does changing the size of the window. The content will always be covered. Additionally, stepping through matches doesn't help because the dialog doesn't move out of the way when a match is found underneath it.

What's my preferred fix? I think a good solution is to model the control after Sublime Text's implementation. In ST's case, a single row dialog slides up from the bottom of the window. If it covers a line of text at the bottom, the content becomes scrollable which allows the user to scroll the content up. Similarly, stepping through the matches will make them visible because doing that repositions the content not the dialog.

I recognize that my preferred fix completely changes the UI which might be too much to accept for the dev team and some users. (Even though I think it would be a net positive change.)

Here are some other possible fixes I came up with.
1. Display the dialog in the same place but shift the content itself down a maximum of three lines.
2. Move the dialog down up to three lines if it covers matches. If it _still_ covers matches (on lines 4,5,6) then move the dialog one line at a time when stepping through the matches. Move the dialog progressively downard, up to three lines, when stepping forward. Move the dialog back up, up to three lines, when coming from below the dialog while stepping backward. In other words, push the dialog in the direction the user is moving through the matches.

There are certainly other options out there but I've spent too much time on this at this point. :)

Thank you for your consideration!

    <Title>Terminal should be aware when a command execution finishes</Title>
    <Description>Currently we support having a `preLaunchTask` specified in 'launch.json' to run a task before a user starts debugging (more details [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)). There are [requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10211) that we support running a `preLaunchTask` even if a user does not have 'tasks.json' setup.

My proposal for this is that the user could specify a full command in his 'launch.json' which we would just forward to our terminal via the `send` api. The only missing piece for this would be for the terminal to be aware when a command has finished running - or when it becomes idle. Currently this problem is solved in the task framewrok by @dbaeumer so maybe we could do something similar in our terminal.

I think @jrieken might be also interested in something similar for the passing of errors from our terminal to the marker service.

@Tyriar let me know what you think and if this request makes sense

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Open integrated terminal;
1. Compile something with huge amount of errors, or print something;
2. Notice that you can't scroll in integrated terminal.
3. Cry.

    <Title>Indentation affects which blocks are collapsible </Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 8.1

I'm not sure if this a bug or not, but I just noticed that indentation/spacing has an affect on which blocks of code are collapsible. 

As it is right now, anything that is indented past the first line of a block will be considered as being part of that block. This makes sense for a language where indentation determines context (Python), but in languages with explicitly defined blocks (JavaScript in this case) I'd expect the collapsible regions to be aware of the defined block.

**Examples:**

    <Title>Extension update visible but not installable due to `engines`</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: macOS sierra

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the [final-newline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samverschueren.final-newline) extension in VS Code 1.5.3 (this is important!)
2. It will install `final-newline@0.2.0` because that one was target to [0.10.x](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-final-newline/blob/v0.2.0/package.json#L7)
3. Enable the extension and search again for the `final-newline` extension in the extension list. It will show that their is an update available, namely `0.3.0`, but that version is targetted to [^1.6.x](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-final-newline/blob/master/package.json#L7)
4. You can try to install the plugin, which looks like it succeeds, but when restarting VS Code, it will again show up as update.

Extension list should show `0.2.0` as `0.3.0` is not supported by VS Code 1.5.3

&lt;img width="302" alt="screen shot 2016-10-06 at 19 29 29" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1913805/19163165/3ead5d42-8bfb-11e6-977e-6cc29cef7d6e.png"&gt;

After installing the extension and enabling it, this is what shows up in the extension list

&lt;img width="303" alt="screen shot 2016-10-06 at 19 30 26" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1913805/19163210/681d8332-8bfb-11e6-822d-a3996ca85eb4.png"&gt;

So it succesfully installs the correct version, only the notification shouldn't be showing.

Now that there is a way to update configuration settings (at either the workspace or user level), it would be great if there was a way to tell where a configuration setting is currently saved. That way if an extension is trying to update a setting it can do so in the proper location.

Maybe `get` or `has` could have an optional `global` bool like `update` which would only check the global (i.e. user) level?

Is there a way to disable the extension? Upon disabling the extension we do not want any command traces in the context menu or a command palette. As of now there is a tight coupling with how the commands are declared / registered. 

For our extension we have a need to disable it if a product license or trial version is expired.

This might be related to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13105 which has been fixed and included in the October release. Given this is likely a common action for users who want to review the release notes next to another editor group, we may want to fix this for September.

The workaround is to drag the release notes to an existing editor group.

    <Title>Zen Mode</Title>
    <Description>It would be nice to be able to go into a mode where the current document takes up the entire editor.

This would mean hiding everything except for:
- Menu bar
- Status bar
- Current document

Toggling zen mode could be done like so: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt;

And now for some sweet GIMP skills to show how this would look (line numbers could potentially be toggled too):

As you can see everything is gone. This is helpful especially when you are on a smaller monitor or have multiple editors open.

    <Title>proxy - connect ECONNREFUSED 191.238.172.191:443</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:
1. connect to your corporate internet
2. use the corporate internet proxy pac file
3. Click Extensions tab

connect ECONNREFUSED 191.238.172.191:443

Proxy should use the local system proxy so we don't have to mess with the settings and store a windows password in plan text.

Check for updates works properly, why doesn't the extension module use the same underlying http functionally of the check for updates routine?

2. Use vscode with dark or dark+ theme

For error, see attached screen dump. Normally defining a colorspace like sRGB when drawing, will solve the problem.

    <Title>Question: Minimum width for VS Code status bar icon</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise (10.0.14393 Build 14393)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a typescript file in VS Code and a function to update the StatusBarItem
   Example:

``` typescript
function uiBold() {
        let statusBarItem: vscode.StatusBarItem;
        statusBarItem = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left);
        statusBarItem.text = "$(bold) Bold";
        statusBarItem.color = "black";
        statusBarItem.show()
        statusBarItem.command = "extension.formatBold";
}
```
1. Create a new status bar item using the bold or italic Octicon icons [`statusBarItem.text = "$(bold) Bold";`]
2. Open the file in debug mode/Extension Development Host] and run the command to launch the function
3. Text (Bold) will render but icon will not.

Expected results
Using the code above, change the bold icon to pencil or gear and run step 3.  Both the icon and text will show.

Question
Is there a minimum width required for VS Code status bar icons?  I've tried a few and the ones that do not work are 10px or smaller in width (&lt;svg width="10px").  Icons that I have tested that are 14px or larger work just fine.

Thanks and please let me know if you need any additional details or if you'd like me to share the ts files for the extension I'm developing.

    <Title>VS Code is difficult to use on a virtual file system over a network (gvfs)</Title>
    <Description>Hi, 
I use the latest version on ubuntu and I work through gvfs.
I like the editor and I am trying to totally move from sublime, but I still have two big problems 
1)  when I switch tab the editor tries everytime to update the content from the network not using the cache, it is nuisance on slow networks.
2) after I save a tab content, randomly, the tab gets closed.
These two things together, turn my working in a hell.
Is there a solution, I bet those are not  bugs but just a setting to change...
thanks

    <Title>Failed to save 'httpd.conf': A system error occured (EACCES: permission denied, open</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3 (1.5.3)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a terminal window type: open /etc/apache/httpd.conf (or a file owned by root)
2. make changes to the file and cmd+s to save.
3. Error appears on the title bar: Failed to save 'httpd.conf': A system error occured (EACCES: permission denied, open '/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf')

I expect VS Code to ask for my password for authorization. Because if I do the same things with Atom, it opens an OSX native window asking for password. Can we have the same window asking for password instead of giving error?
Also, I noticed that this path _/private/etc/apache2_ (in the error bar) is different than what I typed.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Win7 Ultimate 32-bit, all Windows updates installed (VMware Fusion 8.5 on OS X 10.11)
- Pristine VSCode installation (no extensions installed, default settings)

Symptoms:
- On launching, only 2 processes show up: `Code.exe` without parameters, and the GPU process (running with `--disable-gpu` to eliminate the latter makes no difference):

No window shows up, and the `Code.exe`-without-params process is near 100% for ca. 2.5  minutes, with very little memory activity and virtually no IO (the GPU process shows virtually no CPU or GPU activity); the I/O spike and memory increase at the end is when the window finally opens:

Once the window is visible, additional `Code.exe` processes appear, CPU activity subsides, and things appear to work normally.

    <Title>Terminal window *incredibly* slow.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up VS Code.
2. Use the Terminal window by typing something in.

I never really noticed too much but with the latest versions of Code and Ionide (which use the Terminal window now for F# output), I've noticed that the Terminal window is really, really slow - not just for output sent to the terminal from F# but also just typing in the standard terminal - long pauses (1/2 seconds) before it "catches up" with what I'm typing etc.. It also blocks the main editor window whilst these pauses happen.

I suppose that this could be any number of things - happy to help provide more details that would help.

    <Title>Request for features</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Win10
1. I think we should be able to disable extensions without uninstalling them.
2. I see no obvious way to ignore files on Git. Brackets has an obvious option that is extremely easy to find. Maybe I miss something here?
3. I see no obvious way to clone repos from VSCode. I think it should be able to do this.
4. I can't find a good way to adjust the font size globally (not only in the editor). The best I found was this while trying to make fonts look more like Brackets and I don't like it much:
   "window.zoomLevel": -0.3,
   "editor.fontFamily": "arial, sans-serif"
5. All the file-icon extensions that I tried have their icon blurry. Not sure why, but I guess it has to do something with VSCode itself and its HTML.
6. Maybe the "button" for running the build tasks (and maybe also running the code) should be in a more accessible place?
7. I see no way to view the history with Git.

1. When using "Open with Code" from right click dialog in Windows Explorer, VS Code opens up the file behind all other open applications. This occurs if VS Code already has other open windows.

When I git-revert a file, it can't be edited.  File appears in tab, but selecting that tab doesn't update the body from the previously selected file.  

In attached screenshot, .ts file tab is selected, but shows .scss content (and typing updates the latter)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit a file
2. revert with VSC git tool

Workaround:

Restart VSC (reopening file doesn't work)

After publishing [test-extension-pack-1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/extension-deps-sample), I updated it to add another dependency to it, and also incremented the version. After it was published, the extensions pane never updated to inform me of an updated version, and queries for `@outdated` were similarly unsuccessful. Restarting VSCode and waiting did nothing either.

Eventually, I searched the marketplace for that extension, and it popped up into the list, with the appropriate Update / Uninstall buttons, which in turn prompted the outdated list to be updated (extension appears in `@outdated` query)

From what I understand, this way allows user to only pick one item out of the whole list. Is there a way to allow user to pick multiple items? I could not find anything for this on the [vscode namespace API](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api).

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the zoom feature on the editor (Ctrl/=)
2. Open the Preview Window.
   The Preview window will not open zoomed. It will only show as much text as is visible in the editor window. Using the zoom hot keys causes the Preview Window to jump to the correct zoom.
   If you open a second Preview Window by clicking on a link the new Preview Window is correctly zoomed. However if you close the second Preview window the firs one reverts to its original unzoomed state.

    "bluebird": "^3.4.6",
    "copy-paste": "^1.3.0",

const copyPaste = require('copy-paste');
const open = require('open');
const async = require('asyncawait/async');
const await = require('asyncawait/await');

I get the following error when starting up my extension:

I reinstalled `node-fibers` but continued to get the same errors. I know there were some issues a while back (#1556) and I'm not sure if this is related or not. I don't see any issues related to `node-fibers`. Any clues?

Also, I'm using just plain JS. Not TypeScript for the extension.

It would be great if one could disable extension (as opposed to uninstalling it)

Something similar to how Chrome allows to Disable or Uninstall extension

I've felt the need for this while redesigning the [git history](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/gitHistoryVSCode) extension where the plugin itself is hosted within a webview, and thus can't access the parent's classes to determine whether the vscode editor has dark or light theme.

    <Title>Shows number on extensions icon when no extensions installed</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.6.0-insider (d81ee41c51cae93a5cac967e42a28660a3a7e005, 2016-09-23T06:10:40.972Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393

I had two extensions which needed updating on the Insiders Build. I updated them, but skipped the "Enable" and restart part to install the new Insider build. When I did that, it still has the number 2 on the extension icon (updates?). I've tried uninstalling all extensions, and even completely uninstalling Insiders (do not have regular version even installed), and also deleted the .vsinsiders-code folder in my home folder and the one under AppData\Roaming\Microsoft. So I don't know what this number means unless it is bug. Also tried reinstalling both extensions (C# and PowerShell) after, no good. Shows no extensions need updating but still has number "2" on extension icon.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.

2. After VSCode restarted prompt "Visual Studio Code will be updated after it restarts." appears again and in "About Visual Studio Code" neither version nor related commit has been changed. 

Are there any update logs? And does Visual Studio Code store files outside of ~/Application Support/Code - maybe filesystem permissions are missing.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the explorer window to a folder location
2. Open a new instance of VS Code. Attempt to open the same folder in explorer and VS Code activates the previous instance.

This behavior isn't desired if I'm trying to do a find in files and I need to compare the results. A setting to disable this behavior would be nice. I would like to have two instances of VS Code open to explore the same folder location.

    <Title>Extension published, tested, uploaded, refuses to install - "not found".</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.3
- OS Version: Windows 10

I wrote a simple extension today and published it for use. 1.0.0 apparently published successfully and appeared on the marketplace and in the extensions list, but attempts to install it failed, as per this issue. I then wondered if the publish had silently failed somehow, so I published a minor 1.0.1 update, and that seemed to work. After I used it for a few minutes, I found a minor issue that I wrote a small fix for, and then published a 1.0.2 update, and though it appeared in the marketplace as it should, I was unable to update from 1.0.1. After I restarted vs code, the extension failed to load at all and I discovered that the extension folder had only a manifest file and none of the other files in the extension package. I tried then installing it from the command line and got an HTTP 500 error.

I then tried unpublishing and republishing, to no avail. I also tried updating the version to 1.0.3 and though the publish appeared to complete successfully, VS Code refuses to download and install it locally. I have verified with a friend who lives in different country and uses a different OS, and he is experiencing the same issue.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Verify that the extension exists in the marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NathanRidley.autotrim
2. Try to install it in vs code ("autotrim")
3. Error: "extension not found"
4. Try installing from command line
5. "Extension 'NathanRidley.autotrim' not found."

5. Notice no recently opened folders/files :(

And it would be cool if shift-clicking the taskbar icon would open another instance. But that's even more minor than this minor feature request.

Great Job on it so far though! Loving it!

    <Title>Code is not getting a proper focus when opening from command line</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Windows 7
- **Not** running VSCode as administrator or with any compatibility options enabled.

I'm not sure if this is a _bug report_ or a _feature request_, so please let me know if this is happening just to me / just to Windows 7 / etc.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use command line to open VSCode _(with or without a file being specified)_
2. Behold at the blinking Code's taskbar item and not at the Code's window, which - by my opinion - should have been thrown on the top of other windows.

**Some visual context:**

This is happening when I'm trying to run Code from/using:
- WScript's `shell.exec()`
- Total Commander's command line _(as in the pic)_
- Windows' `cmd.exe`

    <Title>SQL Language mode incorrectly interprets a backslash as an escape character.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Any

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Use a the sequence, `\'` at the end of a string literal.
2.  Observe that code following step 1. is incorrectly colorized until it hits another singlequote.

A code sample:

```
DECLARE @var nvarchar(20);

SET @var = 'C:\this\work\sok';
PRINT @var;
SET @var = 'C:\this\causes\issues\because\of\trailing\backslash\'
PRINT @var;
-- It's valid SQL, but the colorizer is puking on it, as you can see from this line and the previous;
-- the backslash is not a valid escape character in SQL.

```

    <Title>showInputBox: Default value not returned on ENTER</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Windows 10

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create an extension with the following code.

```
        vscode.window.showInputBox({ value: "A default value", prompt: "Provide some information", placeHolder: "", password: false }).then((info) =&gt; {
            if (info !== undefined &amp;&amp; info.length &gt; 0) {
                vscode.window.setStatusBarMessage(info);
            } else {
                vscode.window.setStatusBarMessage("no value provided");
            }
        });
```
1. Invoke the command but do not change the value from the default (you want to take the default value).
2. Press ENTER.

**Result:** "no value provided" is displayed in status status bar.  In the debugger, the value of info is "".
**Expected:** "A default value" is displayed in the status bar.

I get the Expected result on VS Code 1.4.0.

If you update the value but keep it the same (e.g., delete the last 'e' and then re-type the 'e', then press ENTER), "A default value" is displayed in the status bar.  If you change the value to any other value, that other value is displayed as expected.

    <Title>Artifacts in UI after Code is open for a little while</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.2 (66f37fd2a99eb9d628dd374d81d78835b410c39b, 2016-09-12T13:30:03.456Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14915

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sorry, no specific steps to repro

After having VS Code open for a while, editing multiple tabs, etc., sometimes the UI will become corrupted as in the following screenshot, and every action taken (moving the cursor, switching tabs, typing, resizing the window, etc.) causes the black squares and unrendered text in the window to move around).

The amount of time VS Code is open before corruption can occur, or number of tabs opened before corruption occurs seems random. I've seen this start when as few as 1 tab (or even a lot of tabs) are open, or if it has been running for as little as a couple minutes, up to many hours.

The only workaround seems to be to restart VS Code which is a pain especially because it doesn't have an automatic session restore like Notepad++ does.

I've been encountering this issue periodically since Insiders 1.3 or so but I've been trying to get some kind of reliable repro before reporting -- but I've been unable to do so, so I'm reporting it now.

    <Title>Ability to auto detect encoding when opening a file which is not encoded in UTF-8</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Windows 10 1607 64bit

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a file which is not encoded in UTF-8(etc, contains Chinese characters, encoded in GBK)
2. the Chinese characters are not displayed correctly.
3. Reopen with encoding, and choose Chinese(GBK), the Chinese characters are displayed correctly.

I hope VSCode can auto detect the file encoding when opening, and open with the correct encoding, not need to reopen with correct encoding manually.

Thank you.

    <Title>Ability to listen for command events in the extensions API: `onCommand(...)`</Title>
    <Description>When creating an extension the author can activate it by listening for a specific command event, however this is the only time when an extension can seemingly respond to a command.

It would be very useful to have an `onCommand(...)` type listener option.

My use case was creating an status bar extension that could watch for build tasks `workbench.action.tasks.build`, and then also listen for `workbench.action.tasks.terminate` to be able to show an icon to illustrate the watching task, and provide and option for terminating it through the UI.

However I believe this functionality would be very useful to other extensions, as would an API for checking running task statuses etc. but that's a separate issue.

    <Title>rxjs `switch()` method breaks syntax highlighting</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: Windows

Steps to Reproduce:

1 Paste the following code into a new file `foo.ts`

```
declare const Observable: any;

const interval$ = Observable.interval(1000);

interval$
    .map(x =&gt; Observable.fromEvent(window, 'click').takeUntil(interval$.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 10000)))
    .switch()
    .subscribe(foobar);

function foobar(x) {
}
```

2 Notice syntax highlighting for the code after the `switch()` method call no longer works:

3 Uncomment the `switch()` method call and notice all is fine with the syntax highlighting:

I believe that VSCode is getting confused because `switch` is also a Javascript statement.

    <Title>showInputBox does not pass preset value</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.5.2
- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use `vscode.window.showInputBox`
2. pass a string to the `value` options field
3. Hit enter

Please have a look at the following code:

``` typescript
window.showInputBox({
    prompt: 'Please enter a variable name for the default export',
    placeHolder: 'Default export name',
    value: declaration.name,
    validateInput: s =&gt; !!s ? '' : 'Please enter a variable name'
}).then(defaultAlias =&gt; {
    if (defaultAlias) {
        console.log('something set!');
    }
}));
```

The value in the `value` field of the options hash is not passed, when the user just hits "enter". So if the user is fine with my prediction, an empty string is passed to the promise. The problem is, that this also happens when the user hits escape.

In my opinion, `showInputBox` should pass the inserted value to the promise IF the user hits enter and `undefined` when the user hits escape.

Cheers

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the integrated terminal

It works as expected but every character typed in the terminal appear after 0.5~1s. I have the same setup at work but the console is responsive. So there is probably something in my home setup that don't play nicely with the integrated terminal. Note, that if I open a command prompt (or a powershell prompt) outside VSCode the prompt is responsive like I expect it to be. by the way, my computer is more than capable of running VSCode fine.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable File Icon Theme
2. Browse files

When icons are enabled, file names are pushed right and make it look like directories are expanded:

    <Title>Crash when debugging extension and you close the dev tools too quickly</Title>
    <Description>VSCode Version: `Version 1.6.0-insider (1.6.0-insider)` 50bb7aad57cbf1924e28472de52734be49645558
OS Version: `OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 (15G1004)`

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start debugging an extension
2. After the new instance of code starts, click the restart button in the main code instance
3. When the new instance starts again its dev tools seems to open (for some reason) and if you click its close button too quickly both instances of code crash

It might take a couple of times to get it to happen, but I can reproduce it quite reliably.

Steps to Reproduce:

  Observe: the stop icon changes from a red square to the crossed-plug icon.

Since the stop button really kills the extension host window, we should not use the 'disconnect' hover text and the crossed-plug icon but show the red square.

    <Title>Allow to disable extensions selectively</Title>
    <Description>The first thing I typically ask a user when an issue is reported is to run with all extensions disabled. However, if one extension is causing issues and 30 are installed, it is very hard to find the one causing the issue.

Ideally we have UI to disable an extension selectively (from the extensions viewlet) so that a user can easily find out which extension is causing issues. 

Optionally we could also allow to do so from the command line, e.g. "`code --disable-extension vscode-icons`"

    <Title>Navigating back after a 'go to declaration' might leave the cursor in a slightly different spot</Title>
    <Description>Say you have this code -

```
function f() {



}

setInterval(f, 1000);
```
1. Click in the middle of `setInterval`, then next to `f`
2. Press F12 to go to the declaration
3. Press ctrl+- to navigate back
4. The cursor will be in the middle of `setInterval`, not where it was when pressing F12.

Looks like we don't save cursor position changes unless they are somewhat far from the previous position, so when navigating back, we end up somewhere near where we came from, but not the exact spot. Maybe when doing a navigation like for pressing F12, we should save the original position of the cursor in the history stack?

Steps to Reproduce:
When I press "CMD+]" it splits the window where indent is expected.
I'm using Karabiner to match the behavior with US keyboard but it doesn't seem to work as expected. Replacing it with US keyboard worked as expected.

I don't see similar oddities when using Atom or SublimeText. I imagine VSCode is reading native keypress events?
#6020 seems to be related.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Zoom the UI
2. Open any WebView (e.g. Extensions Details or Preview of a Markdown File)

The opened WebView is sized for a zoom, but not scaled, staying at 100%, leaving empty space in it's container.
When Zooming with the WebView being open, it is sized and scaled correctly.

    <Title>Need HTML Matching Keystroke</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4
- OS Version: Windows 10

In HTML editor, need a keyboard mapping that allows you to jump to the matching tag.  I am aware that if you place the cursor on a tag, the matching tag is highlighted; but in a div that may sufficiently long as to not be visible on the screen, it would be useful to quickly jump to the matching tag.

It would also be extremely useful to have a keyboard mapping that selects the entire current block.  e.g., Ctrl+B within a div selects the entire div.  This facilitates quickly re-arranging elements within a document without visually hunting for the beginning/ending tags of an element.  

Thank you for this great editor and providing it as free &amp; open source!

    <Title>No syntax highlight at some points in js files</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4.0
- OS Version: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5

Hi,

using VSCode to write some javascript, sometimes it ends up with no syntax highlight at some points in the file.

Here is an example of what I'm talking about :

&lt;img width="842" alt="capture d ecran 2016-08-25 a 14 15 05" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7422824/17968669/5c307636-6ace-11e6-8c4e-a013b64f1570.png"&gt;

The code is correctly formated and functional, and it actually have a correct highlight on other editors like atom for example). I'm using the dark+ theme and I've already tried to install some other themes and adding highlight snippets to see if they made a difference but the problem was still here.

Hope you can help

- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Added `"common/typings/**": true,` to `files.exclude` &amp; `files.watcherExclude` &amp; `search.exclude` of Workspace Settings and restarted vscode
2. When doing `CMD+P` then files from these folders still show up - I think it should respect the setting (folder is hidden in Explorer and non searchable - just shows up in CMD+P)

For example, provide a box where you can start typing in the file name and the Explorer is limited to showing files that match. Please support wild cards.

For example, allow typing in the Explorer to jump to a file.

    <Title>Closing file open in 2 places opens "save" dialog</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4.0
- OS Version: OS X 10.11.5

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a project in VS Code
2. Split the editor so 2 files can be viewed side by side
3. Open the same file twice and arrange so both are visible
4. Make an edit to the file (either one - the changes should sync between the two views)
5. Try closing one of the instances of the file

**Desired behavior:** The file will close with no prompt, since there is another instance of the file still being edited
**Current behavior:** The file will prompt you to save. Not only that, if you click "Don't Save", the file will revert to the version on disk, and any work done on the file will disappear from the instance still open.

Allow Extension QuickPick list items be formatted with HTML, this would allow extension creators:
1) Have some additional "hidden" information using tags
2) Style selection options to make it more convenient for user

A use case I often use in ST3: `cmd+d` to select class names, then `ctrl+d` to expand to the container in question and finally `ctrl+w` to wrap all the containers in another container.

In VScode, any action apart from text editing (typing or deleting) will remove all secondary cursors.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or more files in an editor group.
2. In one of the opened files scroll down a number of lines.
3. Press `CTRL+TAB` multiple times until the editor group revolves to the original file.

=&gt; You will notice that the previous cursor position was lost and that the cursor has moved to the first column in the first line of the file.
### Suggested behaviour:

The cursor position for each opened file in the editor should be retained.

---

PS: I'd like to propose an option to have `CTRL+TAB` not only cycle through opened files within a _single_ editor group but through _all_ files in _all_ editor groups. This would reflect common Microsoft style guide and program behaviour and would increase daily VS Code usability.

- VSCode Version:
  Version 1.4.0 (1.4.0)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a text document in vscode with a fair amount of text. 
2. Launch the Find/Replace dialogue "Command + F" 
3. Click the regex icon to enter a regex pattern for the find and replace forms. 
4. Observe there is no means from that dialogue to save the regex pattern or reference previously used regex patterns. 

Expected Behavior: 
1. The Find/Replace dialogue would provide a means of saving regex patterns used for future use. Please see attached screen shots of the method BBEdit uses to accomplish this as an example of this feature.

For an example of what I mean, check out this screenshot of an outline from a Java file in Eclipse:

It displays the names of all types on top-level, and folded within them are the names of all fields and methods, including their names as well as parameter and return types. Clicking on a member in the outline jumps to the declaration. The icons indicate if the method is public (green) or protected (yellow).

As somebody who used Eclipse extensively in the past, I find it very difficult to program without such a view.

I noticed an unfortunate interaction between the MS C++ extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and one of the popular bookmark extensions (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) where depending on how you open a document you may get different URIs, ex. /foo/x.cpp if you open the document "normally" (selecting it from the explorer panel) vs. ///foo/x.cpp if the document is opened through "search for symbols".

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a simple test extension that logs the arguments to vscode.workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument
2. install the C++ extension mentioned above
3. open the same C++ source file

2) runs chrome browser in debug
3) hit breakpoints on both

    <Title>Open in command prompt opens console with lowercase Drive Letter on Windows</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.4.0 (6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679, 2016-08-04T16:45:31.680Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + C
2. The new Command Prompt now has a cwd that starts with "**c**:...." instead of "**C**:\" as when opening the command prompt from e.g. the explorer

This results in problems with webpack ( "There is another module with an equal name when case is ignored.") as the paths to the modules are inconsistent.

Although i don't use it, this issue seems to be the same with the integrated terminal.

    <Title>change the debugger controls from a floating toolbar to a more in-line one?</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4.0
- OS Version: MacOS

I find that the floating debugger controls - while not taking up much space - can obscure tabs that I'm sometimes interested in seeing. I think moving the debugger controls to be in-line with the find controls would make the UI work a bit better.

&lt;img width="455" alt="screen shot 2016-08-14 at 11 35 07 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269969/17824923/a5ab79aa-6619-11e6-88a9-9a32610ab54e.png"&gt;

If the debugger controls were in-line with the find (and the replace) controls, they would only obscure parts of the first few lines of a file instead of parts of the editor tabs. I think this would be an improvement. That in-line control could re-size as necessary to hold the debug panel, the find panel, and the replace panel.

    <Title>RenameProvider should be able to signal whether a location is valid for a rename</Title>
    <Description>Currently a RenameProvider can be instructed to make renames that are not valid, eg.:

``` dart
import "dart:html";
```

Here, you can rename on the `import` which makes no sense. While it's possible for us to return no edits, it's weird to give the user a textbox pre-populated with `import`.

It would be better if a RenameProvider can be queried to see whether a rename is valid for a given location and Code can then avoid showing the rename box entirely.

    <Title>VS Code fails to start if current directory no longer exists</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.4.0 (commit 6276dcb)
- OS Version: Ubuntu Linux 14.04
## Steps to Reproduce:
1. On Linux (or possibly on OS X), open two separate terminal windows.
2. In both windows, run `cd` with no arguments so you're in your home directory.
3. In the first terminal, run:
   - `mkdir foo`
   - `cd foo`
   - `echo "Hello" &gt; file.txt`
4. In the second terminal, run:
   - `mkdir bar`
   - `cd bar`
   - `code ~/foo/file.txt`
5. VS Code starts up fine, and loads `~/foo/file.txt` without problems.
6. Exit VS Code.
7. In the first terminal, run `rmdir ~/bar`. This will succeed on Linux, because processes don't lock their current working directory while running. So having a terminal window open, `cd`'ed into `~/bar`, does not lock `~/bar` and it can therefore be removed by other terminals.
8. Now in the second terminal, run `code ~/foo/file.txt` again. VS Code will fail with the following error:

``` plain
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
sh: 0: getcwd() failed: No such file or directory
path.js:1184
          cwd = process.cwd();
                        ^

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd

    at Function.Module._load (module.js:290:25)

    at Module._compile (module.js:413:34)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:422:10)
```
## Notes

I believe this could also be reproduced on OS X, because I think the OS X file system works similarly to Linux, but I don't have access to a Mac to test it. I was able to verify that this does NOT occur on Windows, because on Windows you can't remove a directory while any Command Prompt windows are open in that directory, and so this bug reproduction fails on step 7 on a Windows machine.

    <Title>Undoing git checkout</Title>
    <Description>This is an improvement I think:

I am used to from other editors that if I checkout some unstaged changes I don't loose that in fact. Because I can always undo them in my editor.

But with VS Code - event though I really like it - it is impossible. Because when I do `git checkout change-i-don-want.md` suddenly VS code forgets that there were some changes and "undo" (or `ctrl+Z`) is not impossible - changes are simply gone.

That is not a big deal but still - my editor should prevent me from doing mistakes and this is one very likely to happen.

    <Title>Add support for background tasks</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4
- OS Version: Windows 10 64-Bit

VC Code tasks are currently blocking. I.e., no other task can be executed until the currently running task has finished. There are situations, though, were it makes sense execute a task while another one is still running. Consider the following example:

I am writing a TeX document using VS Code. I have two tasks. One **build** task that runs pdflatex on my document in order to generate a pdf from my tex file. And a **show** task that opens my pdf in my pdf viewer (SumatraPDF in my case). SumatraPDF supports modifications to the currently shown pdf file while the viewer is still running. I.e., I could change my tex file and run my **build** task. SumatraPDF detects this and updates as soon as the new pdf is finished. However, as the **show** task is running until I close SumatraPDF, I cannot execute the **build** task. Being able to run **show** as a background task that does not block other tasks from being executed would solve this.

I also tried to workaround this by using grunt-exec but I was not able to find a configuration that solves my use case.

Best
Frank

P.S.: Thanks for this great and fast code editor! The more I use it, the more I can imagine that it has the potential to replace a lot of other editors that I am currently using for different tasks.

I don't really know that this is a valid bug or not . But this issue really annoy me a lot. When I close a tab from VSCode the animation happens ( the close icon goes up slightly and comes back) but the window won't close.

Steps to reproduce : 
When I click right over the close Icon everything is fine the animation happens and the window closes. but if I clicked slightly down the X mark the animation still happens made me think it will close but it never does. Does the animation means something else?

    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.5.0-insider (1.5.0-insider) || Version 1.4.0 (1.4.0)
- OS Version: OSX El Captain 10.11.6

I had a project on my Macbook where the intelisense was working perfectly, then my Macbook has been sent for repair and in the meantime I am using a different one. I have cloned the project I was working on, did an `npm i` and `typings i`, then downloaded VSCode and I was ready to rock, but sadly intelisense doesn't work at all. (No code completion on imports, no go to definition, nothing.) With the very same vscode version (installed before) and same project codebase revision on my colleague Mac it works well. And with a freshly installed vscode insider too.

I know its not enough for a bug report, but sadly this is all I can tell, there are no errors, it just doesn't work for me while works for others for the very same codebase.

"Reinstall" doesn't help and there is no error in the console.

What other info should I provide to make this bug solvable?

    <Title>vsce publish fails due to linting issue</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4
- OS Version: OSX

I have an extension (https://github.com/cfjedimaster/htmlescape-vscode) that I'm trying to publish to the store. It tests fine in Code, but when I vsce publish, I get:

Executing prepublish script 'node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile'...
Error: Command failed: node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile

Ok, it would be nice if it told me the error (grin), so I tried running the command directly:

src/extension.ts(112,9): error TS4091: Loop contains block-scoped variable 'editor' referenced by a function in the loop. This is only supported in ECMAScript 6 or higher.

So... I have something that works in Code, but isn't allowed by vsce?

- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delay update because I'm in the middle of something
2. Forget (or not convenient to update) until the next morning
3. Help -&gt; Restart to Update &amp; Install
4. Wait for a few minutes or do Help -&gt; Check for Updates
5. Another build is available
6. Restart to update &amp; install again

It would be nice if when restarting to update, it would check for the most recent installer and install that, instead of installing and then checking again, so that I need to install again.

    <Title>Prompts for loss of changes when closing split</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.4.0 (6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679, 2016-08-04T16:45:31.680Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a document
2. Click on the Split Editor button
3. Make a change to the file
4. Go to close one of the two splits

You now get warned about data loss and whether or not to save the changes, even though you aren't closing the file completely. If you click on "Don't save", one of the splits closes, leaving you with the file still open, but your changes are lost! This happens regardless of which split you made the changes in and which split you close.

The desired behaviour would, surely, be just to close the split, leaving the file still open, no loss of changes and no prompt of loss of changes?

    <Title>debugger sidebar data presentation</Title>
    <Description>this is how the PHP Debug extension is presenting output - it is the only one i have used so i do not know if this is common.

![screen shot 2016-08-10 at 7 45 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/881944/17575926/6582d7a2-5f33-11e6-9370-b0c2af684c9a.png)

is there a better way to view this than waiting 3 seconds for the hover tooltip (which sometimes doesn't happen), like line wrapping that sidebar section, or being able to redock that section to be under the code editor similar to the integrated terminal, or some such thing.

to be honest, it would probably still need line wrapping even if redocked. those messages are long and the information needed is generally over half way in.

- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to some line/column (eg. `10:30`)
2. Press `Cmd + Up`
3. Press `Cmd + Shift + Enter` to enter new line above (eg. to put new import)
4. Press `Ctrl + -` to go back to location you were editing

Cursor will jump to line number `10` and most likely column `1` (if this happens to be empty line)

Ideally if it would jump to line `11:30` so you can continue typing whatever you were typing

Sublime handles it pretty good (will go to exact location that cursor was - code wise - not line number wise)

Use case is similar to: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10409

    <Title>Delete a folder from the explorer pane doesn't work</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4.0
- OS Version: Windows Server 2008 R2

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on a **folder** that contains one or more files and folders, and select 'Delete'
2. (You'll be prompted to move to recycle bin)
3. Click 'Move to recycle bin'
4. (Notice that the folder doesn't show up in the explorer anymore)
5. Click the refresh button

Observed:
- The folder comes back, it was never moved to the recycle bin

Note: Deleting a single file works, but deleting a folder doesn't.

After looking more into it... it seems that if there is a problem deleting the folder (due to permissions), VSCode doesn't let the user know, so the problem is about reporting a problem deleting a file/folder.

    <Title>How to detect if a line is visible (in the Viewport)?</Title>
    <Description>Hi,

Is there any public API to detect if a `line`, `range` or `position` is currently _visible to the user_ (in the Viewport)? I'm naming _Viewport_ because that's how it appears in `vscode.TextEditorRevealType` (`InCenterIfOutsideViewport`).

Thanks in advance

    <Title>Explorer Context Menu ordering issues</Title>
    <Description>Testing #9153 (test plan #9702)

using https://github.com/chrisdias/vscode-opennewinstance

here is my menus contribution:

``` json
"menus": {
            "explorer/context": [
                {
                    "command": "extension.openNewInstance"
                    ,"group": "navigation"

                },
                {
                    "command": "extension.scopeToHere"
                    ,"group": "navigation"
                }
            ]
        }
```

This results in a menu that looks like this:

&gt; Open to the Side
&gt; Reveal in Finder
&gt; Open in Terminal
&gt; **Open New Workbench Here**
&gt; **Scope Workbench to Here**

Scenario: I want to move the second menu to the top of the list.  I set up my menus contribution to look like this:

``` json
"menus": {
            "explorer/context": [
                {
                    "command": "extension.openNewInstance"
                    ,"group": "navigation"

                },
                {
                    "command": "extension.scopeToHere"
                    ,"group": "navigation@-1"
                }
            ]
        }
```

Expected: Given that "Legacy commands have the implicit order of zero (navigation@0)" I expected only the menu item that has a weighting &lt; 0 to move to the top of the list, such as:

&gt; **Scope Workbench to Here** (@-1)
&gt; Open to the Side
&gt; Reveal in Finder
&gt; Open in Terminal
&gt; **Open New Workbench Here**  (no order specified)

However, it looks like this:

&gt; **Open New Workbench Here**  (no order specified)
&gt; **Scope Workbench to Here** (order @-1)
&gt; Open to the Side
&gt; Reveal in Finder
&gt; Open in Terminal

However, if I change the ordering as follows, where the first menu item has no ordering but the second does:

``` json
        "menus": {
            "explorer/context": [
                {
                    "command": "extension.openNewInstance"
                    ,"group": "navigation"

                },
                {
                    "command": "extension.scopeToHere"
                    ,"group": "navigation@1"
                }
            ]
        }
```

The result in this:

&gt; **Open New Workbench Here** (no order specified, why did this move to the top of the list??)
&gt; Open to the Side
&gt; Reveal in Finder
&gt; Open in Terminal
&gt; **Scope Workbench to Here** (order of @1)

I dont understand why the first menu is now at the top of the list, while i can see the second one is at the bottom of the list (because @1 is &gt; @0).

&lt;kbd&gt;Tab&lt;/kbd&gt; will now focus away from the editor instead of inserting a `TAB`.

    <Title>Terminal lacks focus indication</Title>
    <Description>Testing #9695

Through two separate situations, I've been able to get into a state in which the terminal lacks focus indication through the cursor:
- Simply disable cursor blinking (related to #9753). When moving focus to the editor and back to the terminal, there is no indication that the terminal has focus at all.
- Or, leave the blinking cursor, run the `htop` command, exit it with &lt;kbd&gt;Q&lt;/kbd&gt; and the terminal will then lack focus information when moving focus to the editor and back again.

    <Description>Testing #9723:

With copy/paste in the context menu, I expect also the copy/paste shortcuts to work.
I suggest to copy if there is a selection and send the Ctrl-C sequence to the terminal if there is no selection.

    <Title>FATAL: laptop shut off as if plug was pulled -- in-progress file now corrupted</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Code 1.3.1 (e6b4afa53e9c0f54edef1673de9001e9f0f547ae, 2016-07-12T13:35:06.227Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586

Steps to Reproduce:
Please, god, no... I don't want to corrupt another file or make my laptop hard shut off.  

Here's what I know:

I am not going to say that the laptop shutting off is VSCode's fault -- it may have just been coincidence that I was typing in it at the same time.  The laptop is fully charged on batteries and was plugged in as well.

The file I was working on was a .js file with es6 syntax.  I was using the multi-line edit functionality at the time and had 4 slices of text in my clipboard.

When I turned the machine back on, windows came up no problems.  I signed in and all my applications were closed, so I know it completely shut off -- not just randomly sleep.

When I re-opened VSCode it looks like the rest of my files are there.  The corrupted file looks like it was completely wiped and 0-written (or something).

Possibly a bug with the auto-save?  Concurrent access?  I was typing when this happened.

Sorry I don't think I can provide a lot more, but this was BAD BAD BAD.

Corrupted file contents as opened in Sublime:

    <Title>openNativeConsole cannot have Custom Keybinding</Title>
    <Description>Because of issue #7904 I was needing to set a different keybinding for openNativeConsole. However, it is not respecting the keybinding being set in keybindings.json. No matter what I try to set ctrl+shift+c remains the keybinding.

This may also be happening with ctrl+shift+v and preview.
- VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insiders 7/25
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a new keybinding for openNativeConsole
2. test copying text in the console input.

When using a custom bash prompt for git, the first message in VS Code integrated terminal on show is:

`bash: __git_ps1: command not found`

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Modify bash prompt (from .bash_profile):

```
# Change command prompt
source ~/git-prompt.sh
export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
# '\u' adds the name of the current user to the prompt
# '\$(__git_ps1)' adds git-related stuff
# '\W' adds the name of the current directory
export PS1="$green\u$purple\$(__git_ps1)$blue \W $ $reset"
```
1. Open integrated terminal in VS Code

Note: Config works fine in Terminal application.

    <Title>How can we reuse editor of another language in any file</Title>
    <Description>Basically it like HTML can edit css and javascript in `&lt;style&gt;` and `&lt;script&gt;` tag

I am using couchDB and have a hard time edit its document. couchdb work with javascript in json so I need to write javascript in string

something like this

``` JSON
{
  "_id": "_design/_auth",
  "language": "javascript",
  "updates": {
    "test": "function (doc, req) {\n if(!req.id)\n return [null,JSON.stringify([doc,req])];\n}"
  }
}
```

Something like this. It hard and ugly so I want to make it easy by developing vscode extension

Could you please guide me?

Also I have heard from typescript team that vscode still lack this feature so they can't put salsa editor in HTML file. If it's true then I would like to make feature request

    <Title>Show long file and folder names on hover in the file explorer</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: Win10 Build 14393

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Expand a couple folders deep (such as the contents of `bower_components`)
2. Watch your file and folder names get cut off
3. Profit

I'd like to see a tooltip or something that displays the full file or folder name on hover if it's cut off. This also makes multiple files that start with the same value impossible to tell which is which since they're clipped.

A horizontal scrollbar in the explorer might be nice as well, but the tooltip would be enough.

2. Select a `.vsix` file in the file picker
3. Observe that the interface does not show any notification.

If I start vscode multiple times from the command line with file as parameter it opens for every file a new instance.
Is it possible that vscode opens the files from command line in the same instance. So that I get the behavior of geany (editor on ubuntu).

    <Title>runtimeExecutable for different operating systems</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 &amp; Ubuntu 16.04

I am using vscode on both windows (At work) and linux (At home). The issue I am having is with using electron on both OS's.

I have the `runtimeExecutable` set to `${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron` which works on my linux machine but doesn't work on my windows machine.

I then have to change the `runtimeExecutable` to `${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd` on my windows (note the `cmd`). Changing these all the time gets annoying.

Is there a way to define a windows executable and a linux executable? Maybe in a way like this:

``` json
"runtimeExecutable": {
    "linux": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
    "darwin": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
    "win32": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd",
},
```

And when mac/linux use the same executable:

``` json
"runtimeExecutable": {
    "unix": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
    "win32": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd",
},
```

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: OS X EI Capitan 10.11.5

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a word, there is NO Scrolling Bar in the Integrated Terminal Panel, and I can't scroll view up to top to review more information.
2. Detail:
   In the **Integrated Terminal Panel**, execute `dotnet run` command, then visit `http://localhost:5000/api/values/5` in the Chrome browser, response 500 status code(_I leave an error in my codes purposely, so as to generate more information_) from server side. Back to VSCode, in the Integrated Terminal Panel output information more than shown at Panel's Height, but **MISSING the Scrolling Bar** in the panel, result in failing to scroll view up to review entire exception information. At present, only via resizing the height of Integrated Terminal Panel for looking more output info up.

    <Title>(Duplicate) Request: Reveal in tree (In Open Editors context menu)</Title>
    <Description>Hi there, I believe this has not been requested yet after my search.

What I want is to be able to right click on files in the `Open Editors` and have an option `Reveal in tree` which would find the file in vscode tree. That option could be listed right before `Reveal in explorer`.

That feature would be awesome as I am currently working with an angular project. I sometimes open a `controller` and find myself adding a depedency which is then needed in the `component`, so an option like that could save time in a big project.

    <Title>Use require logic for typescript.tsdk</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1

In the `settings.json` you can configure the path for `typescript.tsdk`.
You _can_ use an absolute path which _always_ finds a TypeScript language server (at least if it is available), but you can't have different versions of TypeScript for different projects.
You _can_ use a relative path (like `node_modules/typescript/lib`) which allows you to use different versions of TypeScript for different projects, but it _can't_ find a TypeScript language server, if `node_modules/typescript/lib` isn't in your root (e.g. if you use multi-package repositories or multiple independent examples in one repository).

It would be nice, if vscode could just try to `require` `typescript/lib` relative to the current opened TypeScript file which would probably be the most natural way.

  07-19T05:07:05.876Z)
- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14390

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open VS Code
2. Open some files from disk
3. Open some Untitled editors and make some changes
4. Close VS Code
5. Reopen VS Code

Actual:
Nothing was opened and need to reopen editors (especially frustrating with daily updates to VS Code).
(And no option to change this behavior to opt-in.)

Desired:
The same editors and workplace that was opened when I closed VS Code are reopened so I can continue working where I left off with minimal disruption.
(There should at least be an option to opt-in/opt-out of this behavior.)

Clarifcation:
Should work even if a workspace/folder was not opened (just using VS Code as a text editor).

    <Title>Missing output with clear then scroll</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: OSX Yosemite 10.10.5

This could be a mismatch in opinion for the behavior of `clear` or `Ctrl-L` and scrolling (as I believe I've seen this behavior on a Linux Mint machine), but here's my problem:

Let's say I have a lot of output from a certain command in the integrated terminal (mine uses bash). If I enter `clear` or `Ctrl-L`, the terminal gets cleared, which is good! However, if I scroll up, a chunk of output from the verbose command is missing (seems directly related to the height of the terminal window).

What I expected: Using _my_ default bash terminal on my Mac, the screen gets cleared, but if I scroll up, **all** the output is still there.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the integrated terminal (I supply the `-l` option in `settings.json` in order to use my `~/.bash_profile`)
2. Run a command with lengthy ouput (e.g. `ruby -e 'puts "START";100.times { |n| puts "Line #{ n + 1 }" };puts "END"'`)
3. Enter `clear`
4. Scroll up

With the terminal occupying around 80% of my screen height, I only got output of that Ruby command to around line 50 (i.e. I never see "END" after clearing).

If this is just a matter of terminal opinion, it might be nice to have an option in `settings.json` to define the clear/scroll behavior.

    <Title>VS Code does not play nicely with Git Bash for Windows</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586

Frequently when I open a repository in VSCode and do some kind of operation from the command-line in [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), such as `git rebase`, `git commit`, etc. I will get this error message:

```
fatal: Unable to create 'C:/Users/James/Code/git/coreclr/.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
```

Sometimes this conflict will mess up local changes I've made (e.g. once it caused Git to skip 2 commits while I was rebasing), which means I had to force-pull everything from the remote and start all over again.

The thing that's kind of strange about it is when I do a `rm .git/index.lock`, most of the times the file will no longer be present; it appears spontaneously _only_ when I try to run a Git command from the terminal. Re-running the command once or twice seems to get rid of the error most of the time; however sometimes the `index.lock` file stays and I have to manually remove it.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a consistent repro for this since it seems to only occur randomly when VSCode is open on the repository; but it's never happened after I closed the editor. (I haven't noticed any pattern even though this has been happening to me for months.) Nevertheless, it would be greatly appreciated if someone could take a look into this, even though I can't tell what's causing it.

Thanks! :)

1. Turn off showTabs (`"workbench.editor.showTabs": false`)

The new context menu command is not available. But if you turn on showTabs (`"workbench.editor.showTabs": true`), the command appears.

Thanks in advance

    <Title>Windows Explorer shows File type as Visual Studio Code for Files Set to Open with VSCode</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro Build 10586.420

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set VSCode as default application to open with raw text file of yet-unknown file type (e.g. README.md has unknown .md file type; set README.md to Open With VSCode - and default VSCode to open all files of .md file type)
2. View file in Windows Explorer and under "Type" column, shows "Type" as Visual Studio Code.

The file shown should display whatever the file-type/extension is; in the example given above, should display MD File or perhaps even Markdown as file type as it does if set to open with any other text editor like Sublime.

    <Description>_From @jchannon on July 13, 2016 7:55_
## Environment data

`dotnet --info` output:

```
.NET Command Line Tools (1.0.0-preview2-003121)

Product Information:
 Version:            1.0.0-preview2-003121
 Commit SHA-1 hash:  1e9d529bc5

Runtime Environment:
 OS Name:     Mac OS X
 OS Version:  10.11
 OS Platform: Darwin
 RID:         osx.10.11-x64
```

VS Code version:1.3
C# Extension version:1.2.2
## Steps to reproduce

Do a global search with regex turned on and with capture groups eg `(this)` then in the replace enter `$1` which will replace what it finds with the first capture group
## Expected  behavior

Replace with the value of `$1` not the actual string of `$1`
## Actual behavior

Replaces all found items with the string of the capture group

    <Title>Debug variable overlay disappears when mouse not over text editor</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insider (commit 50a0945)
- OS Version: Windows 7 x64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a JavaScript or TypeScript application in debugging mode (F5)
2. Set a breakpoint
3. Hit the breakpoint
4. Mouse-over a variable
5. The "debug variable"? overlay appears
6. Move the mouse cursor still inside that overlay, but outside of the editor region
7. The overlay disappears

Description: When I wanted to debug an application, I used the debugger with the "variable overlay" to inspect variables inside the editor. However, when I wanted to inspect a variable that was rendered in that overlay _but_ was outside of the editor region, the overlay disappeared, even though it should have had the mouse focus.

The following image shows what I mean:

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3
- OS Version: ubuntu 14.04 LTS 
- Node.js Version: 6.2.2

Hi there, I can't install extension in VSCode 1.3 I just updated my editor to 1.3 and want to install a theme 

`ext install theme-dracula`

I click the little green buttons to install the theme but nothing happens. I opened the Dev Tool and the following error appears.

```

Steps to Reproduce:

I'm not working as a root user. Each time the app asks me to download/install the update, it seems to work, but when the app is restarted, I get the old version. After a while the app asks again to update.
I always need to download the new version manually from the site and install it.

I guess it has something to do with new tabs feature. Right click gives missing options but it's really tedious to right click every time you want to move to the next change...

Older version 1.1 looked like this:

    <Description>- VSCode Version:1.3.0
- OS Version: Win10

Some code snippets are very usefull but extremly annoying at the same time.

In some cases, code snippets take precedence over class members, see this .tsx file for example:

&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/sxd7fa2.gif" alt="http://i.imgur.com/sxd7fa2"
 /&gt;

another example is conflict between new keyword and new code snippet:
&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/lvgXy2x.gif" alt="http://i.imgur.com/sxd7fa2"
 /&gt;

it makes intellisense quite annoying

    <Title>Allow to 'resolve' a SymbolInformation</Title>
    <Description>Working on a Java language server...

`WorkspaceSymbolProvider.provideWorkspaceSymbols` returns a set of `SymbolInformation` where each SymbolInformation contains a location, including the source range of the element.

The problem is that acquiring the source range of an element is quite expensive in our case, as it requires opening the document that contains the symbol. (The symbol index we have does not contain source ranges).
As the open symbol action doesn't really need the range until the user selects a symbol to be opened, it would be good if the API would have an additional hook that allows to resolve a SymbolInformation element, similar to what is there for CompletionResults.

    <Title>Duplicate copy of file created when renaming the containing folder and changes to file not saved.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: Windows 10 Build 14385

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder (A) and place a couple of files in the folder with VSCode
2. Save any changes
3. Make an edit to one of the files in folder (A)
4. Do not save the changes to the file
5. Now rename folder A to folder B
6. You will not be prompted to save any changes or prevented from renaming the folder
7. If all goes as expected you will end folder B containing all the files from A _AND_ folder A will still exist with the edited version of the file and no others.

Certainly not a showstopper but it caused me concern at first when I went to edit the edited file in the new folder B and my edits had apparently been lost.

Would be great if it prompted you to save changes and proceed OR cancel the rename until changes had been saved.

Cheers,
James

- OS Version: Linux x64 3.19.0-64-generic (Ubuntu 14.04)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter Ctrl+Shift+P, type `&gt;install extensions`, and press Enter.
2. In the Extensions column, type `ReactSnippets`. Extension `Reactjs code snippets` should populate.
3. Click the green `Install` button, and there is no response. This behavior is the same for every extension attempted at this time. 

Maybe worth noting that this behavior only began after upgrading to 1.3.0. Extensions installed correctly before the upgrade. In addition, can confirm that extensions install properly on OS X after VSCode upgrade.

    <Title>global search and replace doesn't respect regex variables</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.5

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try using a regex with a `$` variable in global search and replace. For example replace

`for(.*)` with `cat$1`

In a single file search and replace this replaces 'for' with 'cat'. In a global search and replace it deleted the whole line after `for` (including for), replacing it with `cat$1`, removing the rest of the line. Basically, it doesn't realise it should treat `$1` specially.

- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.4.0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Finder on Mac
2. Find a folder with a number of source files. Drag the folder onto the VS Code window.

Past behavior would add the folder/subfolders and files to the VC Code "solution". This is now broken and you must click the folder icon, "Open Folder" button and go find the folder you would like to add, which is cumbersome and time consuming.

In previous versions of VS Code you could drag and drop folders to the editor pane in VS Code to open them.  As of 1.3 this functionality no longer works.  Nothing in the release notes says that this was removed, only that the drag and drop was enhanced.

    <Title>Closing split view prompts to discard saved changes</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any file, make some changes to it (don't save)
2. Split the editor
3. Make more changes; close one of the splits and choose "Don't save" -- changes are reverted even though the file is still open and in plain sight.

It makes sense that the changes are discarded since I said Don't save, but it does not make sense that I should have been prompted that at all.

Don't quote me on this (I didn't test it) but I have a feeling this is a regression.  I feel like I've done this all the time.  I quickly tested by disabling tabs and still get the same result though.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install version 1.2
2. Update to version 1.2.1
3. Update to version 1.3
4. Click extension icon
5. Search for "eslint" (for example)
6. Click on "install"
7. Nothing happens, but errors show in Developer tools.

Error in developer tools:

It seems that version 1.2 was called visual-studio-code and version 1.3 is called code so both are installed simultaneously. Removing version 1.2 does not make a difference.

Workaround: 
1. Remove version 1.3, 
2. Install version 1.2.1 &amp; start application
3. ctrl-P, type ?  (typing ext install directly will not work)
4. select "Extension install"
5. Search &amp; install the wanted extensions
6. close application
7. Install version 1.3
8. Extensions are installed and working

    <Title>TypeScript errors in new files until reload VSCode</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: Windows 7 Version 6.1 SP1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install angular-cli 1.0.0-beta.9 `npm install -g angular-cli`
2. Create a new Angular project `ng new TestApp`
3. Open TestApp-Folder with VSCode
4. Create a new TypeScript file in the src/app folder e.g. first.component.ts
5. Insert code in file (see below)

As you can see now VSCode shows some errors in first.component.ts
1. Cannot find name 'module'
2. Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option to remove this warning.

When you take a look in src/tsconfig.json you'll see that **experimentalDecorators** is set to true that typings.d.ts is included in the files section. While src/typings.d.ts declares the module variable.

Only if you reload VSCode the errors disappear but when you have a TypeScript file in a (sub-) subfolder it may happen, that the error will appear again.

**src/app/first.component.ts**

``` typescript
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: "first-component",
})
export class NameComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

    constructor() {}

    public ngOnInit() {}

    public ngOnDestroy() {}

}
```

Steps to Reproduce:

    <Title>VSCode remains opened sometimes after being closed</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: just updated to 1.3.0
- OS Version: Debian Jessie 64bit

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start VSCode
2. Close VSCode

**Detailed description:**

I've recently installed VSCode for the first time on my system. I've noticed that after closing VSCode a couple of processes remain active namely `code/code`, `Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.linux` , `code/code /usr/share/resources/app/out/bootstrap --type=SharedProcess` and probably a bunch of others which I haven't found yet. `code/code` is (if I'm not mistaken) the main process of VSCode. And the fact that all other processes remain in memory can only mean that VSCode hasn't actually closed and keeps running in the background.

The first time my alarm bell rang was when my system exhibited high memory usage and high CPU usage (resulting in a core temperature of 68 degrees Celsius or so with the usual temperature being approx. 50). I then noticed that this happened **quite often** (but **not always**) after I used VSCode. When I opened `htop` to view the active processes I was really surprised to find out that `Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.linux` was there and it was eating up approx. 25% of my CPU resources...half an hour or so after closing VSCode. Further investigation showed me the other processes related to VSCode that I've mentioned above.

    <Title>Allow to customize command palette via CSS</Title>
    <Description>Hi there,

This is not an issue, more like a request/suggestion.

I'm probably not the only one prefering the command palette from Atom to the one of vscode.
I like how they styled it.

My request/suggestions is that you add something to allow us to customize vscode visual elements (like the command palette) from within a custom stylesheet(that we would specify on the configuration file) or change the style of elements via the Extension API.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I am hoping we can see this one day

    <Title>Feature Request: Bind mouse buttons</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0
- OS Version: Linux (Fedora 24)

Unless I am mistaken, there seems to be no way to remap/bind mouse buttons. One very useful use case for this is to drag-create multiple cursors by holding ctrl/alt+middle_mouse. Currently I need to manually select each individual line with alt+left_mouse (which i cannot remap to ctrl+left_mouse) which can be very tedious when I want to quickly select 15~ lines on the same column.

A good example of this would be the following Atom extension: https://atom.io/packages/Sublime-Style-Column-Selection or, as the name suggests, it is a native feature in Sublime Text.

    <Title>Add support for rebinding Column Selection</Title>
    <Description>Currently there is no way to rebind column selection. The only bindings that can be changed for column selection are as follows:
![](http://puu.sh/pVyet/447aaf5f64.png)

 In other programs it's bound by default to `middle click` or `alt+drag`, but in VSCode it's bound to `alt+shift`. It's not an inherently bad thing to do bindings different than other programs, but it'd be nice if it was configurable. I'd really like to change it to `alt`, personally. [And I'm not alone, either.](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1515#issuecomment-224232517)

It's possible that it can already be rebound, but as it's not in the `Default Keyboard Shortcuts` file, there's no way for the basic user to find out that it can be rebound. This would be an even easier fix if that was the case, tho--simply add an entry for it.

    <Title>Add key binding condition - terminalFocus</Title>
    <Description>Correct me if I'm wrong, but there doesn't seem to be a key binding condition for when the terminal is focused.

This makes commands like `workbench.action.terminal.focusNext` useless as you have to use the mouse to focus the editor.. defeating the purpose of the key binding in the first place.

Something along the lines of `terminalFocus` would be awesome.

    <Title>Too long path of an extension side effects in Windows flipping to TEMP user profile</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.\* and 1.3
- OS Version: Win7
- User: User with a roaming profile

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Have an Windows user with a roaming profile
1. Install VS Code
2. Make sure that your .vscode got created within profile
3. Install extension with a bit too long path, i.e. lukehoban.Go-0.6.39 will do
4. From now on 
- in your profile might be already corrupted (logout might take longer or on login you will get TEMP profile)
- upon login, in Event Viewer, you should see something along the lines of
  Windows cannot copy file \?\UNC\SOMESERVER$\profile$\SOMEPROFILE.vscode\extensions\lukehoban.Go-0.6.39\node_modules\console-stamp\node_modules\dateformat\node_modules\meow\node_modules\normalize-package-data\node_modules\validate-npm-package-license\node_modules\spdx-expression-parse\node_modules\spdx-license-ids to location \?\C:\Users\SOMEPROFILE.vscode\extensions\lukehoban.Go-0.6.39\node_modules\console-stamp\node_modules\dateformat\node_modules\meow\node_modules\normalize-package-data\node_modules\validate-npm-package-license\node_modules\spdx-expression-parse\node_modules\spdx-license-ids. This error may be caused by network problems or insufficient security rights. 
  
  DETAIL - The filename or extension is too long.

I suppose it's related to #3884 as having extensions outside profile or even in AppData wouldn't cause such issue?

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider

Currently, when you open a side panel and then click back in the editor area, the side panel remains open. 
It would be rather handy to add a button (pin or something) which changes this behavior for each panel, allowing to either keep the current way of working or making the side panel auto-collapse when you click outside.

    <Title>Git operations in VSCode prevent git operations in other applications.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider
- OS Version: Windows 10

I have been running into some issues with the the auto-fetch and other polling git operations. My general workflow is that I:
*Edit files as necessary
*Switch to the command line and do whatever git magic I need to do
*go back to using VSCode

However, since VSCode performs git actions at least every 10 seconds which means that if I am perfoming a long string of git operations in my terminal, then I often run into the `fatal: Unable to create 'C:/path/to/repo/.git/index.lock': File exists.` error. The only way to ensure this doesn't happen is to close out of the editor and reopen when I am done with whatever I am doing with git.

The editor really shouldn't have to be running full-on locking git operations every time it wants to check up on a file. This is a problem I haven't had with Atom, so I will look into what they are doing, and post that below in this issue. There are definitely other options on determining the file changes.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a repository in VSCode
2. Try switching between branches
3. Every third (or so) operation will result in the `fatal: Unable to create 'C:/Users/Austin/Documents/rust-on-gpu/.git/index.lock': File exists.` error

Note: It might be more likely to occur with more expensive git operations.

    <Title>cannot delte some folder/files in work place after VS code opened.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version:1.2.1
- OS Version:Windows 7 Professional 64bit
- Git Version:2.9.0.windows.1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open my work space, i see the process info like this:
   ![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15505291/16571312/692507b8-428c-11e6-830f-55c1f8b000f5.png)
   as you can see, no process opens the folder.
2. Click the Git Icon on the left navigator, and open a changed file to see the changes on index or stage a file or other git operations, then i see another two code process actived, and they're handling the angular folder result that the folder can't deleted or renamed.

    <Title>command variables severely broken</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0

Steps to Reproduce:

In a launch config pass this argument array to a node program that prints the arguments:

``` ts
   "args": [
      "--pid=${command.PickProcess}"
   ]
```

Observe: the argument value is only the value of the PickProcess command. The "--pid=" is missing.

This bug breaks command variable substitution in a severe way.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple object like var person = { name = "foo" , age = 24 };
2. write person. (type dot). Nothing happens. Press ctrl + space, it shows no suggestion.

I just want to know is this the desired behavior ? I have tried the same thing in brackets and it works perfectly fine.

    <Title>Search results can differ between disk match and editor match</Title>
    <Description>@sandy081 not really something that you caused, but I thought I would file this because you seem to want to look into reducing debt in search land for disk match vs. editor buffer match.

Consider you have 1 match in a file and you edit the file to remove the match. The search results nicely update live and show that you no longer have results. However, once you close the file in the editor, its associated model gets disposed and search suddenly goes back to showing the disk result, which now is outdated and still shows the match. I think the disk result needs to be updated as well when the editor changes.

Here is a video showing the issue:

    <Title>Current open file relative path variable</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.1
- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.5 ( OS X El Capitan )

Steps to Reproduce:

I have this line in my launch json for testing just current open file:

```
{
            "name": "Test - active test file only",

            "type": "Ruby",

            "request": "launch",

            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",

            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/rake",

            "args": [
                "test",
                "${fileBasename}" or "${file}"
            ]
        }


```

rake test needs relative path of the file. ${file} gives complete absolute path and ${fileBasename} just gives the name of the file. is there any variable to get relative path of the current open file? I want to run this script:

rake test test/integration/my_test.rb

@Tyriar all the bugs I file are on mac and insiders vscode.

IMHO there is too much space between the terminal header and the first line, I would expect this to be more compact - especially since most of the time the vertical space is very limited.

3. Change the constructor of the customer-edit.component.ts by adding a parameter.
4. Open the "Error and Warnings"-Window
5. No errors are displayed although the spec.ts will not be able to compile due to a changed constructor in the customer-edit.component.ts.
6. OPEN the spec.ts file
7. Suddenly in the opened "Error and Warnings"-Windows you get the typescript error.
8. But thats far too late.
9. I do not want to click in every file to see the errors...

    <Title>Support using environment variables in settings.json</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.1
- OS Version: Windows 10 (1511)

It would be nice to be able to use environment variables in paths in settings.json, this is not possible in build 1.2.1 and older.

In my scenariio I`m syncing VS Code settings between computers, for example:

// Specifies the path to a PowerShell Script Analyzer settings file. Use either an absolute path (to override the default settings for all projects) or use a path relative to your workspace.
    "powershell.scriptAnalysis.settingsPath": "%home%\.vscode\PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1"

%home% is different on the computers VS Code is used on, thus it can`t be hardcoded.

    <Title>Workbench to support left hand side of diff editor to be editable</Title>
    <Description>It seems that the left hand side of a diff editor is now suddenly editable with the new search &amp; replace preview feature. The workbench is not really fit for allowing other editors (non-file, non-file-diff) to be editable nor do I believe is it discoverable or expected to be able to type on the left hand side. You will quickly notice that typing in the left hand side suddenly opens the file (as a tab in the background) and you also do not get any dirty indicators in the title area of the editor.

If we want the diff to be editable I suggest to do what we do when you compare 2 files or open a git change: The right hand side is editable because the right hand side is an instance of `FileEditorInput`.

Otherwise, please disable editing to the left until we have a story from the workbench to make this happen.

    <Title>SetVariable doesn't trigger reevaluation of stale variables</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider, 2016-06-23

Assigning to a variable doesn't prompt a reevaluation of any variables that depend on it. Variables can be stale after setting a variable in languages such as C# (e.g. a property in the locals window), and watch expressions can be stale in all languages since they can be arbitrary expressions dependent on the changed variable.

    <Title>Visual Studio Code shouldn't hijack .config extension association</Title>
    <Description>After installing 'Visual Studio Code' .config files started to be associated with VSCode.
I am not sure that VSCode is a better editor for config files than Visual Studio or Notepad++. So user should make a decision which program should be associated with each extension, in particular such multi-purpose as .config. Installation should associate with VSCode only new extensions, that not used by anyone else.

And now in file explorer for files with .config extension type is shown as 'Visual Studio Code'.  It doesn't make any sense.
Please fix the installation ASAP.

It's a second bug with VSCode type associations that I noticed

    <Title>Problems with git commands and vscode</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: ANY
- OS Version: Windows 10 (should be any)

When I try to run commands such as `git checkout`, `git rebase`, or even `git stash pop` from the command line (powershell), many times it fails to complete the command, failing with this error, or an equivalent:

```
fatal: cannot create directory at 'src/app/...': Permission denied
```

The command also fails and thus leaving me to do a lot of manual cleaning up to restore to previous version.

It seems to me that vscode locks up the files and doesn't let Windows access them creating this problem.

Probable Steps to Reproduce: (I can't reproduce it completely reliably, but it's a start)
1. In a git repo, create a new folder and move an existing (tracked) file into that folder
2. Now stash your changes with a `git stash -u`
3. Now, apply your stash.
4. Fail

---
1. Make some changes to your code.
2. Pull from upstream.
3. Try a rebase
4. Fail (70% of the time)

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2

When using vscode on Mint Linux the intellisense starts as broken.
with no clear indication of there being a problem.
only after toggling the developer tools and looking at the console is it clear some problem exists and googling it brings up the FAQ.

A user may just assume intellisense is not supported because no indication of an error is displayed on the GUI.

I believe such errors should be shown to the user with a link to the page explaining how adjust the configuration of the system to avoid them.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install vscode on fresh vanilla mint 17.4 x64 (tested on 4gb ram , 2cpu core, 20gb ssd VMware player and virtualbox instances)
2. try to use intellisense functionality on a javascript project.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on a file in the files list, choose "Reveal in Explorer"

observe that the explorer window opened does not come to the foreground.

Usually this type of problem us due to not passing the foreground privilege on correct. If COM is used to transport the call from one thread to another use CoAllowSetForegroundWindow() on the COM object that will invoke the API that opens File Explorer.
Also verify you are using SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems API to open the window and select the file.

The images are designed for a light background on the marketplace and an optional custom color selected by the author. This makes extension images that were designed to look good in those circumstances look crappy and unprofessional in the dark theme.

Instead it should just be removed from the list as long as I am in replace mode.

    <Description>Refs: #8184

I find it currently hard to understand that the results list shows different matches when you have focus in replace and typed something. You show the preview of the operation. If we want to keep this concept, we should at least show the before and after in one line, e.g. you could strike through the old result and show the replacement right after. I would also use different colors for that.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I like how we use a different background color in the search box depending if we show search results or replaced results
2. However the color difference is very subtle - it should be much more prominent IMHO
3. You just change the transparency by 0.15 - maybe increase this, and also you might need different change based on light / dark theme

This looks super bad and we should use the custom scroll bar if possible for the inner scroll bar and the outer scrollbar should just be hidden via CSS if possible.

It would be _very_ useful for me to have some sort of way both to monitor when a tab-complete action is triggered (and in particular to retrieve the text that was completed). I need this for things like macros and the . command, which repeats what the user just did.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.1

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an app with a large output to the console, e.g. crash report, console.dump etc.
2. Try to copy and paste 10 + lines of output on a small screen
### The Issue

I am using an M'soft surface, so the small screen makes the debug window is small. 
1. Using `shift + up` to select multiple lines rolls over into the code screen rather than scrolling the console. 
2. If I select a line and then manually scroll up through many lines while holding shift and then click the new line (10 or so lines higher - they don;t all fit on the screen) however, scrolling up and down shows them highlighted, copy and paste only shows the last 4 lines (presumably the only ones that were visible at one go).

Experienced this on 2 different Macs today. Got the usual notice asking me to if I wanted to "Update Now" by restarting Visual Code. Restarted and once I restart, I'm asked the same question again. Once again, I restarted Visual Code. After this "ext install" says "No results found" even if I try extensions I know should work ("ext install c++", "ext install cmake"). 

I noticed this by luck on one Mac earlier this morning. I thought I had screwed up my install somehow, but now that I see it on two different Macs I believe it's a bug with Visual Studio Code.

I like how it looks in the list, and I think it should have consistent color with the one in the header but I believe we can find a color which will work for both places.

Maybe increasing the size as suggested in #7964 might fix this issue

    <Title>Clear button not visible enough </Title>
    <Description>The current extensions input clear has some flaws:
1. Too far away from input
2. Looks disabled
3. Too small
4. Mouse does not transform to click while hovering over it
5. No hover information
6. Looks out of style compared to our other input buttons (find, search)

Due to this reasons this button can easily get ignored

6. Go back to step 1 and you can run it once.

Interestingly, I can run it from the terminal over and over again.

```
open Visual\ Studio\ Code.app
```

I had it in ~/Applications and thought that might be the issue, but after moving it to /Applications, I get the same behavior. It's happened I think for a couple versions. I only run it once every 2 weeks or so. Also, if it helps, I have had my laptop crash while VSCode was opened in case you can think of any kind of corrupted application state data that might do this.

My guess is something to do with my .bash_profile.

At the minimum the hover should have a different background color. Also in this example the JS doc comments look very similar to the actual method signature. I would love if both could be made more distinct so that its clear the one is documentation and the other is signature.

4. Get the error 'No handler found for the command ...' An extension might be missing an activation event.

Notes:  Extension works properly when `npm install` is run in the extension directory.  When it's packaged or published and installed in the client, not all dependencies get installed, leading to "missing module" showing up in the developer console.  I've added about 30 low level dependencies, and it currently works on one of my macs and not the other, they are the same versions and OSs

    <Title>Only Render Whitespace on Selection</Title>

In Sublime, there's an option to only show whitespace when text is highlighted. 

&lt;img width="363" alt="screenshot 2016-06-17 09 19 42" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269421/16157344/fb07502e-346c-11e6-990a-c7ffa44d511f.png"&gt;

In my opinion, this helps with code readability, while still allowing you to see whitespace if you need to. Code currently only supports whitespace on/whitespace off.

It might also help to tone down the weight of the whitespace indicator.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.1

Steps to Reproduce:

**proto.js**

``` js
module.exports = MyClass;

function MyClass() {
  this.prop = null;
}

/**
 * @param  {any} required
 * @param  {any} [notRequired]
 * @returns {MyClass}
 */
MyClass.prototype.optionalParam = function(required, notRequired) {
  this.prop = required;

  if (notRequired)
    this.prop += notRequired;

  return this;
};

MyClass.prototype.secondMethod = function(param) {
  return 'Hello';
};
```

**index.js**

``` js
const proto = require('./proto');

let pInst = new proto();

//pInst.optionalParam('hello')
//pInst.optionalParam('hello', null)
```

Uncomment the second line and hit `.` after it. You'll get the proper Intellisense.

When editing JavaScript files in my project and I want to use the built in snippets like `for` and `console.log`, VSCode suggests a ton of snippets, but none of the ones I want.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13225609/16081712/8f689380-3306-11e6-92e7-0b04e6415fb0.png)

To test this in isolation I actually created a new JS file on my desktop and it didn't have any of these random snippets and it did go directly to suggesting the pure JS snippets.

So I'm not sure what's happening here. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

    <Title>Adding a root level item experience</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.0
- OS Version: OS X 10.11

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Folder in VS Code that has no root files, only Folders
2. Try to create an item at the root and not inside any of the folders.

If a folder is selected, items are created as a child of it. If a file is selected, new items are created along side that file. This makes adding "root" items a bit tricky, and if your project has no files in the root, only folders, seemingly impossible.

    <Title>Cmd + number should focus editor at index and not focus groups or split</Title>
    <Description>1. Have multiple tabs open
2. Press cmd + 2 - expect that the second tab gets focus (like in all other aps)
3. Instead a new editor group gets created

While in tab mode cmd + number should always focus that tab. Opening a new group should have a stronger shorctur (more keybindings).

I think this could be solved by just adding additional shortcuts in keybindings.json on appropriate positions because Alex gives priority based on where in file it appears.

    <Title>Add Document Types to Webview</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.0
- OS Version: Linux

When providing html to `vscode.previewHtml` the doctype is stripped [here in the webview.html](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/aaa65451f6f2d6de290ee3cb1c8ce1f2def7a52a/src/vs/workbench/parts/html/browser/webview.html#L81).  This can prevent some styles from not working properly, such as KaTeX which can cause problems like [this here](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/332).  I was working on a plugin that would allow me to render Markdown and KaTeX in previewHtml when I ran into this issue.

I simply wanted to replace the linked code above with

```
target.contentDocument.write('&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;' + newDocument.documentElement.innerHTML);
```

This **does** fix the problem for me.  But I had issues following the contribution guidelines (probably another issue), and there probably is a better way to handle this.

It would be useful if from an extension I could know that some word is a string, a regexp,.. depending on the language.

I am working on an extension that will show a visual diagram of a regex. The problem is that there is no way to know the current selected word is a string and/or regex.

    <Title>Adding ability to insert characters in Keyboard Shortcuts </Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version:
- OS Version:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. 1.2.0
2. OS X 10.11.2 (15C50)

Extending Keyboard Shortcuts with the ability to type letters. I think this would be useful in general as it provides more extensibilty to the shortcuts, but it also allows convenience shortcuts for many languages that are used by many programmers. 

Convenience Examples: c++ and Java, adding the semicolon to the end of a line and moving cursor to next line (this functionality is default in many editors/IDEs and is a clickable option in others like Eclipse).  Python, adding the colon to an end of a line and moving down, another example that is default in many editors/IDEs.

    <Title>[Feat] Add project support</Title>
    <Description>One of the nice things Sublime has over VS Code is workspaces and projects, Sublime allows to set a workspace with configs for it, as well as saving those to load the workspace later.

However the feature i want to reccomend is projects, Sublime is great in that regard since the projects are kind like the workspaces, just that they are remembered and is very easy to change between projects with a few keystrokes.

Currently VS Code doesn't have those concepts so i'm forced to open the top folder that contains all the projects i'm working / had worked on, that's a lot of folders to see, i like clean development environment so it would be a great addition to be able to set projects with just the folders or projects i need, and easily change between projects.

Lastly when i mean change between projects i don't mean like the workspaces of Sublime that we need to change by searching the workspace config file in the root of the workspace or wherever you saved it, i mean like Sublime projects that remember the last ones that were used and with a keyboard shortcut allow to see a list of those and quick change between them.

**Sumary:**
- Add support for multiple base folders in same window.
- Add support for a project manager that allows to save the previous item as a project for easy dev env restoration.
- Add an easy way to switch between projects recently used.

I think this would make VS Code even better, any thoughts about this?

    <Title>Electron Helper draws 100% CPU</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.0
- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.5

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start VS Code
2. Open project folder

Electron Helper process draws 100% CPU as soon as I open a project folder. GUI is still responsive though.

Somehow I suspect that this has something to do with the git pane (**the project is managed by mercurial, not by git!**):
- Open the project -&gt; CPU usage goes to 100% for ~3 minutes
- Git icon shows badge "99+" -&gt; CPU usage falls down to a reasonable level
- After some seconds, CPU usage rises again to 100% for ~4 minutes
- CPU usage is again at a reasonable level

Then, after a make any modification to a file, the git badge switches to a clock icon and after a few seconds it starts again drawing 100% CPU.

    <Title>An API to get a range of visible positions in the editor</Title>
    <Description>It would be useful for extension developers to get a range of visible positions (or lines) in the editor.

This would be useful when the extension is dealing with the visual aspect of the VSCode since the extension does not need to update the visual on invisible area.

For example, [Guides](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spywhere.guides) needs to update its indentation guide lines but this has impact the extension performance (https://github.com/spywhere/vscode-guides/issues/6) due to a calculation on whole file which cause the lag on the VSCode. With this API, Guides can now update only visible area, reduce the necessity of update the invisible area which can improve the performance a lot.

We need to click twice to get our cursor from integrated terminal to the file we are editing

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a file to edit
2. Open embedded terminal
3. Click on terminal and type something.
4. Click on editor(Just above terminal)

If you are editing any *.c file, and you click on opening round bracket, then it will highlight the closing bracket, however the cursor will neither be on terminal nor on editor pane. 
1. Click on editor pane again.

Now the cursor will be on editor pane.

    <Title>Terminal instantly closes</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: both 1.2.0 and latest insiders
- OS Version: Windows 10, latest updates

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to open terminal (both ctrl+` and view -&gt; ...)

It just shows terminal for a brief moment (few miliseconds) and then it closes.
I'm (sometimes, not everytime I try to open it) getting error "write EPIPE".
(this might be cause by holding the key binding button).

I dont have anything else bound to ctrl + `.
Tried restarting, reinstalling, restarting PC.
Tried using both powershell and cmd. (as described in your post).

Thank you for looking at this isuue. (or possibly telling me what am I doing wrong).

    <Title>Huge git repo causes hang</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.0
- OS Version: OS X 10.11.5

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open VSCode
2. Open any folders
3. Browse some code (eg. c++, ts, php). Loading speed should be normal at this point.
4. Leave VSCode alone and do step 3 every 10min. At 30min the opening time of file should be noticeable slower. After 1hr, VSCode will take 3-4 sec to load a 1KB c++ file.

Additionally, I notice one of the VSCode process is using a lot of cpu time even I just let it stay in the background. I highlighted it below:

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Run a program

![](http://i.imgur.com/EwUE5YG.png)

I'm not sure what the solution is here. Maybe a small handle on either side of the debugger that allows us to drag the debugger out of the way? Maybe putting the debugger in the completely blank header of the debug panel?

    <Title>An option to hide the side bar when it's toggled</Title>
    <Description>The **Toggle Sidebar** action only _minimizes_ the sidebar.  It would be really nice to get an option to completely hide the sidebar when it's toggled.

Sometimes I use it but most of the time I do not, and it just takes up space.

A user setting named, for example, `hideSidebarWhenToggled` would be perfect.

    <Title>Markdown syntax highlighing confused by backslashes and quotes</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.1
- OS Version: Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open the attached file [markdown.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/301913/markdown.txt) in VSCode.
2.  Enable word wrap to be able to view the entire paragraph.
3.  Rename the file to have the '.md' extension identifying it as Markdown
4.   Observe syntax coloring of the markdown text.   The entire sentence starting with the phrase "One set of encoded values" is inappropriately colored blue because the syntax highlighting code in VSCode is confused by the example.   

Note: results from processing this markdown using grunt-markdown results in HTML producing the desired effect, the flaw seems to be in the markdown highlighting logic.

    <Title>Debug console window formatting : missing leading spaces</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write NodeJS server that uses console.log to logging purposes
2. Format output, I use `JSON.stringify(packet, null, 2)`
3. Start debugging, output will go to "debug console" (in ru_RU translation it is 'консоль отладки')

Problem is that all leading spaces (between line start and formatted text) are missing.
So if I want to see readable JSON structs, I must run server in OS native shell...

    <Title>Debugger start failing. Not recognizing launch.json file.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.2.0-insider
- OS Version: Windows, OS X, Linux

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new app or open an existing one.
2. Hit F5 to start debugger.

When no `launch.json` file exists VSCode creates it but then refuses to recognize it and start the debugger.

This buggy behavior is noticeable when at start you press F5 from anywhere but the Debugger. If you navigate to the Debugger and hit F5 it works and then VSCode remembers it.

Note: VSCode 1.1.1 works.

It would then only be a matter of calling openTextDocument() with a different schema than file:

``` javascript
var fileUri = vscode.Uri.file(filePath);
var hexUri = vscode.Uri.parse(fileUri.toString().replace('file:', 'hexdump:'));
vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(hexUri).then(function (doc) {
    vscode.window.showTextDocument(doc);
}
```

It would be useful for opening binary files with extension like [vscode-hexdump](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.vscode-hexdump)

An alternative naming is to disable preview tab.

My workflow is that I am used to having all the editors I navigate between in my history. I believe some of our users use it in the same way and with the june changes we might break their mental model.
Due to that we should introduce this setting such that we behave as before - nothing is preview, everything is pinned.

    <Title>Strange build behaviour building TypeScript from VSCode with Node v6 on Windows</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.1
- OS Version: Windows 7, Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

See https://github.com/yortus/repro-build-bug for full repro details and a cut-down project.

From the README:
## Bug Repro
### Problem Description
- Building a project with `Shift+Ctrl+B` puts some built files in the wrong location
### Environment
- **O/S**: Windows 7 and Windows 10
- **VSCode**: v1.1.1
- **Node.js**: v6.2
- **TypeScript**: v1.9.0-dev.20160524-1.0
### Steps to Reproduce
##### Project setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/yortus/repro-build-bug.git`
2. `cd repro-build-bug`
3. `npm install`
##### Baseline build/run (this should work fine)
1. Open a command prompt
2. Build from the command prompt using `npm run build`
   - should be no errors, and `/built` will contain built `.js` files
3. Run from the command prompt using `node .`
   - should be no errors, outputs `"Hello, World!"` to console
##### VSCode build/run (this should repro the bug)
1. Open the project folder in VSCode
2. Delete the `/built` directory created in the previous steps
3. Build from VSCode by pressing `Shift+Ctrl+B`
   - should be no errors, but one `.js` file is output to `/built` and the other to `/src`
4. Run from the command prompt using `node .`
   - should show an error `"cannot find module..."` because of the wrong placement of built files
### Further Notes
- Bug could not be reproduced on linux
- Bug could not be reproduced with node v4 or v5.
- Bug goes away if `"options": {"cwd": "&lt;absolute project path&gt;"}` is added to `.vscode/tasks.json`

    <Title>Make pinning of editors configurable</Title>
    <Description>There is a desire to configure preview editors via settings:
- allow to always pin an editor when it opens
- allow to always pin a file when it opens from quick open

**Original Post**:
I would expect Ctrl+P opening a new editor (which it does) and then adding that file to working files (which it doesn't). Instead the file is just revealed in the tree view and I have to double click on it to add it.

Surely Ctrl+P should be viewed as a "I mean to edit" action and not "Just a quick glance"? Does anybody else share my view?

    <Title>User markdown-it or remarkable to replace marked for markdown render</Title>
    <Description>Should we use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) or [remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) to replace marked for markdown preview?

It seems that marked had beed dead for a long time(see [issue](https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/724)), and many issues and PRs are not responsed.

From above issue, it seems that markdown-it is better than remarkable. see [here](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#authors)

Such as, marked now not support table in lists, but markdown-it and remarkable does.

    <Title>marker view truncates text</Title>
    <Description>Please refer to this screenshot:

![vscode-truncated-text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1445483/12964156/985210d6-d01c-11e5-9171-f97e03aa341a.png)

It appears as though the command palette is truncating parts of the text, and likewise mousing over these messages does _not_ show a tooltip with all the text.

From what I can see, there is no way to see the entire text.

I believe that the proper behavior would either be to:
- show all the text with no action
- or mouse over the message and show a tooltip to display all the text

    <Title>Provide a setting to add each opened file as pinned editor</Title>
    <Description>There is  key bindings `⌘K Enter` to `Add to Working Files`. Is is possible to update some settings to add file to `Working Files` by default when the file is opened in editor?

Many a time I open files just for reference, and since I have not performed any action on the file, it does not get added to `Working Files`. 
If I switch to another file, and want to switch to the previous file, I got to search and open the file again.
If any opened file, would get added to `Working Files`, accessing it again, would be easy in large code bases.

Thanks!!

Besides that, I'm not sure why choosing cmd-2 would open a second/duplicate window for the one I'm already on...

    <Title>VSCode freezes if run as a background process on Linux (0.10.6)</Title>
    <Description>I could start it easily from a terminal as a background process in Fedora 23 (using ampersand). However, after an upgrade to 0.10.6 (64bit), it freezes soon after opening. It was not the case in the previous versions.

I suspect it might be related to the git integration somehow. It freezes if a folder is under git source control. It does not freeze otherwise. When I run it with the verbose option, it stops right before prompting for my repository credentials (which it normally does if not frozen).

Steps to Reproduce:
1. My project is in C language.
2. Root folder structure:
   ---+.vscode

---prj

------(this is where build starts)

---headers

------(only *.h. There are other folders with header files)

---source

------(only _.c. There are other folders with source files)
3. Error message structure:
    ..\source&lt;file&gt;.c(&lt;line&gt;): error: &lt;message&gt;
    example:
    ..\source\serial_commands.c(511): error:  #65: expected a ";"
    task.json :
    "problemMatcher": {
     "owner": "c",
     "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceRoot}"],
     "pattern": {
     "regexp": "^.{3}(._c|._h)\((\d+)\):\s+(error|warning):._:\s+(.+)$",

        "line": 2,
        "severity": 3,
        "message": 4
    }
   }
This captures errors and warnings.
4. When error occurs double click on message to jump to error. That does not work:/

    <Title>Don't debounce searches in the type-to-filter-menus</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.1.1 (1.1.1)
- OS Version: OSX

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any menu, like the find files menu, with ⌘P
2. Type the name of the file

Expected:

The file should show up almost instantly, as I'm typing, since after the first 3 keystrokes it should match, **as I'm typing**

Actual:

I have to stop typing and wait 500ms - 1000ms for the file to show up. It looks like you're debouncing the search function from the menu. This makes the editor feel sluggish. It should be based on an interval instead.

Having the error as JSON is uncommon. Should be a human readable string.
If structured error messages are useful, maybe add a extra option to the command that defines the resonse format.

    <Title>Change file association is doing too many things at once and it is not clear what's going on</Title>
    <Description>Testing #6657 

IMHO the experience is bad. Clicking this action pops over two message boxes and does an edit in an untracked file that gets autosaved immediately.

IMHO this should show a preview of what it will do before jumping in and doing it and not pop over 2 message boxes! Preferably it would select the new added text.

    <Title>Cannot use both dotnet and gulp tasks</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1
- OS Version: Linux/Mint

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install DotNet Core RC2 &amp; upgrade generator-aspnet
2. Scaffold a new Web Application
3. Open app in VS Code 1.1.1
4. Type F1, followed by task, select 'Run Task'

Expected:
List of Gulp tasks

Actual:
Build

Notes:
tasks.json is set up for "command": "dotnet".  If I delete this file and configure a new one for Gulp, I can enumerate my Gulp tasks, but F5 no longer works.
The documentation and file format seem to indicate that there's no way to configure _two_ task runners, so I see no way to run my DotNet Core app _and_ use Gulp.

I plan to use React.  I don't see how I can accomplish this w/o access to a task runner other than dotnet.  I _must_ configure both dotnet and gulp somehow.

    <Title>Equal text highlighting over multiple rows (like Sublime)</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.1
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open this file in VSCode: https://gist.github.com/juristr/0a3a294ce70660f59ba4265f86699fda
2. Select a multi-line code block that from the `activateBaseMap(..)` function that has an identical occurrence in the `onChange(...)` function, like.
   
   ``` javascript
   if (basemap !== vm.emptyBaseMap) {
     vm.emptyBaseMap.olNode.visible = false;
   }
   ```
3. Press `Ctrl+D` (or `Cmd+D`) to enter multi-cursor mode. Actually also just highlighting the line should out-of the box highlight the same multi-line code block in other parts of the file as well.

**Outcome:**

![multiline-vscode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/542458/15469884/73b1ff30-20ed-11e6-8d38-19978fa5f38d.gif)

**Expected:**

This is how Sublime does it on the same JavaScript file.

    <Title>Git console is super buggy</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version:

1.1.1
- OS Version:

Windows 7

Scenario 1:

We have git hooks installed (a mix of #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/node). The printout messages from these do not show in the VSCode console, only when running from command line (in this case, CMD)

Steps
1. Try to commit something with an improper commit message 
2. VSC says the commit failed, offers to show console output for git. Console does not contain output message.

Scenario 2:

We use git pull rebase by default (git config --global pull.rebase true). When Syncing or pulling, VSC will show an error if it didn't succeed. When you show the console output for the error, it does not contain the output message.

Steps
1. Try to rebase after all your commits are in
2. VSC says the action failed, offers to show console output for git. Console does not contain rebase output

Scenario 3:

All git console output just randomly stops sometimes (sometimes totally blank) and won't fix until restarting the editor. Dies again shortly after after usually. It may be dying from one of the above scenarios, however.

Summary:

In all scenarios, git from the command line produces output just fine.

3. Press Ctrl+O to open other file from the same directory of currently edited file
4. But open file dialog starts with something really different directory, probably with directory I last used Ctrl+O with.

                        &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/h2&gt;
```

Copy/Paste above code and try to press, Format Code shortcut, nothing happens.

Expected behavior is that span would indent below in "a" tag. also that div's and a's ending tags will align but nothing happens.

What would I expect is following:

```
&lt;h2 class="project_header section_header"&gt;
        &lt;a class="project_link" href="#"&gt;
               &lt;span&gt;Shopping&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;div class="right_task_actions"&gt;
               &lt;a href="#"&gt;
                       &lt;img class="cmp_share_project" src="/app/app/assets/76084e29cb2cf72b320e888edc583dfb.gif" height="16" width="26"&gt;
               &lt;/a&gt;
               &lt;a href="#"&gt;
                       &lt;img class="cmp_task_actions icon" src="/app/app/assets/76084e29cb2cf72b320e888edc583dfb.gif" height="16" width="26"&gt;
               &lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
```

I have tried also CTRL+SHIFT+X to delete spaces and then do a format again but nothing happened.

Format will not work on following code as well:

```
&lt;h2 class="project_header section_header"&gt;
&lt;a class="project_link" href="#"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shopping&lt;/span&gt;

What is the logic behind code formatting, is there anything we can do by config?

    <Title>Disk name in ${workspaceRoot} is lowercase may result in a bug related to node6, webpack and babel</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: v1.1
- OS Version: windows 10
- nodejs Version: v6

Steps to Reproduce:
( a little bit complicate)
1. mkdir try-bugs &amp;&amp; cd try-bugs 
2.npm install -g vue-cli
2.vue init webpack
3.npm install
4.set up a task in task.json, whose command is `npm`, args is `["run", "build"]`
5. press `contrl + shift + b` to build the project
6.then babel of webpack does not work in the right way

Further description and guess:
I have install a extension of vscode called [new-cmd ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=odonno.new-cmd), which can enable you to open a new terminal from current work space directory by typing command `cmd` after pressing `f1` in vscode.
If I open a terminal using this extension and then run `npm run build` in this terminal, it will show me the same bug as run the build task from vscode.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3315274/15247757/cc4b29d4-1948-11e6-98da-07de74a8b956.png)

However, if I open a terminal manually by right click and run the same command, everything goes well.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3315274/15247842/53734e96-1949-11e6-9f70-fee948c954c0.png)

I notice that there is one difference between the two terminal is that the disk name. The disk name in former terminal is `d:\` while the later one is `D:\`. 
In the project, from one hand, there are some code, the config of webpack specifically, related to `path.join(__dirname, ...)`, which will generate an absolute path to files begin with `D:\`. From the other hand, there are some other code use relative path to locate file, which will result in path to file begin with `d:\`.
I wonder whether this caused my problem or not.
By the way, if I repeat the process with node5, the bug disappear.

3. Nothing starts up - no additional `code.exe`s show up in Task Manager

If I then close all of the active Code windows and try again, things work.

    <Title>Render problem under high DPI monitor</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.1.0-insider, 
- OS Version: Win10 Pro

I got two different text render styles, one is blurry, and another is clear.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/628293/15003152/68b30c4e-11db-11e6-961d-c06e76d8ebba.png)

You can see middle window is more blurry than both left and right window.
My monitor size is 13 inches, with 1920x1080 resolution. Display zoom level is **125%**, and I've set up **Code - Insiders.exe**'s compatible settings, and checked '**Disable display zoom under high DPI**' (may be this, as I'm using a Chinese edition). 

My settings:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch app and open folder which contains Aspnet console app.
2. Configure for debugging.
3. Start debugging  and verify debug console window.
Actual: Long message is truncated and user unable to read complete message from debug console.
Expected: Message should not be truncated and wrap properly. or Mouse hove should show message contents.

The program 'c:\src\TestCSharpProj\TestCSharpWithVSCode/bin/Debug/dnx451/win7-x64/TestCSharpWithVSCode.exe' has exited with code -1 (0xffffffff).

    <Title>Keep history independent of splits</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: Version 1.0.0 (1.0.0) fa6d0f03813dfb9df4589c30121e9fcffa8a8ec8
- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.4

If I split my editor and then navigate through history, navigation will linearize my history such that I cannot step back in history in my in-focus editor split without inadvertently affecting my out-of-focus editor.

For example, if I have editor splits 1 and 2 and my navigation history looks like this (with time moving from left to right):

```
Split 1: File A              --&gt; File B
Split 2: File X  --&gt; File Y            --&gt; File Z
```

If my in-focus editor is split 2 and I want to navigate back in history to File X, I cannot do so without also causing Split 1 revert back to File A, which is very undesirable.

    <Title>Node.js 6.0 messes up debugger when using Typescript with sourcemaps</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.00
- OS Version: Win 10

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install node.js 6.0.0
2. Try to debug within a router.get function.

```
router.get("/:id", (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    controller.getSingle(req.params.id).then(data =&gt; res.json(data));
});
```

When I add a breakpoint at the `controller.` call, the debugger stops when I'm using node 5.11.0. It does not after upgrading to 6.0.0. The debugger stops (so it notices a breakpoint), but it doesn't show the line where it stopped anywhere.

Breakpoints outside of the express calls work fine by the way. So when I add a breakpoint at the router.get, it works (but at the start of the application, which is good, obviously).

Changing from () =&gt; to function() did not change anything.

    <Title>Cannot pass environment variable that is already defined in shell's rc file.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Export a variable in your default shell  (`~/.zlogin` for zsh;  `~/.bash_login` for bash, for example. You can use `.bashrc` as well).
   
   ``` sh
   export FOOBAR="1"
   ```
2. Pass different value of the same variable to VSCode.
   
   ``` sh
   FOOBAR=2 code .
   ```
3.  VSCode uses value defined for login shell, not current session: 
   
   Help &gt; Toggle Developer Tools. And in Console,  `process.env.FOOBAR`  gives "1"  when I expect "2".

It looks like VSCode executes default shell as login shell again before launching the program UI.

Being able to pass different values for existing environment variables greatly helps writing/testing extensions.

    <Title>Virtual Documents and compareFileWith command</Title>
    <Description>I am attempting to modify the Git History extension to use virtual documents instead of temp files, but I am running into issues while executing the `workbench.files.action.compareFileWith` command.

If I open the virtual file first, then run the `compareFileWith` command, I get an error stating `Open a file first to compare it with another file.`, which would result from `workbenchEditorCommon.asFileEditorInput(this.editorService.getActiveEditorInput());` returning falsy.

Attempting the compare in reverse (open disk file, then compare, then open virtual file) I get an exception `Notification handler 'textDocument/publishDiagnostics' failed with message: Illegal argument: line must be positive` that appears to be caused by the fact that `babel-eslint` can't be loaded.

I haven't figured out how to debug the `GlobalCompareResourcesAction` directly yet, but I'll keep on digging. Also, is there a simple way to get a copy of the current call stack, so that I can post it here?

    <Title>Request to add "Close All Files Above / Below" in Working Files list</Title>
    <Description>Many modern editors that have tabs have options like "Close all to the right / left" or "Close all but this..." so you can close multiple files at once. The same can be added to the working files list. Right-click on a file and we should see options like "Close all files above", "Close all files below", and "Close all files but this one". I often organize files in tabs (or in the Working files list in the case of VS Code) according to function within the app I am working on. For instance, I may have a user view, user controller and user model open followed by login view, login controller and login model files. If I no longer need to refer to the login files, I could simply right-click the user model and select "Close all files below" rather than closing each login related file individually. I do this frequently throughout the day regardless of the project I am working on and I am sure this feature would be beneficial to others as well as it is an easy way to quickly clean up the working files list if you have many open.

    <Title>Add ability to clear recently opened files from open file dialog</Title>
    <Description>As far as I can tell, there is no way to clear the list of recently opened files that appears on the CMD+P window.

My problem: I have excluded node_modules from searching. Sometimes I open a package.json file from inside node_modules by navigating from the explorer. 

After that, CMD+P then typing 'package.json' shows all of the package.json files that are in the recently opened list, even though some are from the node_modules directory which is normally excluded from search. 

This can be useful behavior, but the user should be able to clear out the recently opened list so that the search exclusion rules can go back to hiding those files. 

There should be a clear all recently opened files button/command. It may be worth considering a way to clear specific items with an 'x' on the open file dialog that appears with CMD+P. Or perhaps a special command for clearing recently opened files that match any search exclusion rules.

![screen shot 2016-02-22 at 11 46 37 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1946538/13230368/f30685e8-d959-11e5-93cf-6af3d33782fb.png)

Using mocha, es6 and chai with vs code does not debug properly.
1. Breakpoints in tests do not work properly, they may fire but in wrong place.
2. Value inspector does not show local variables defined using let
3. Debugging ES6 files, local variables do not show nor can you view values of function parameters.

Steps to Reproduce:

See attached file.

set breakpoint in calc.js.
when breakpoint hits and you hover over it shows nothing.
typing "value1" in the console states undefined.

set breakpoint in test that will call the calc function, a breakpoint hits but not on breakpoint position.
also can not see local values.

    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.0.1-insider (85f337ee0851a464d5459ce9a354d05f94f0b9a4)
- OS Version: OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have code open with git enabled on a repository (in particular, I'm working with @mozilla/gecko-dev)
2. Do a `git rebase -i` that will take a while (my case had 11 commits that I was squashing into 1)

A few times during the rebase, my rebase stopped because it couldn't create index.lock, saying it already existed. If I then did `git rebase --continue` things would carry on. (FTR, git also totally messed up the squashing in this case, but that's a git bug, not a code bug.) I realized that code's git integration was interfering with my rebase, quit code, `git reset --hard` to the original commit, and redid my rebase, and everything worked fine. My best guess is that the periodic `git status` (or similar) that code does was racing with the various commits of `git rebase`, and when code won, it would mess up the rebase. Code should probably avoid updating its internal knowledge of the working directory status while a rebase (or similar) is running. (Not sure if that's entirely possible, but it's at least something to think about.)

    <Title>Don't offer autocomplete it the only option is what the user has already typed</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 1.0.0
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Python extension
2. Type `pass`

After typing `pass` you will be offered the autocomplete option `pass`. You then have to press enter or escape to dismiss autocomplete before you can press enter again for a newline (pretty much what you always want after a `pass`).

![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/376842/14601549/8b406a28-055a-11e6-80be-6089fca47213.PNG)

The result is that you have to mash enter to get newlines sometimes. It's a bit annoying. Autocomplete should hide itself if the only option is what the user has already typed (i.e. if pressing enter would just dismiss it).

    <Title>simplify telemetry implementation</Title>
    <Description>Today we have an interface that describes the contract of telemetry (ITelemetryService) which is OK. The bad thing is that there many implementations of that interface (AbstractTS, MainTS, ElectronTS, AbstractRemoteTS, WorkerTS, ExtHostTS, NullTS, MockTS, TestTS) which have led to leakage and duplication of events. I believe this problem should be solved with less code and abstraction

    <Title>Allow to open same folder in multiple windows</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11
- OS Version: Windows 7 x64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Visual Studio Code (called window 1)
2. Open D:\Project
3. CTRL-SHIFT-N or File -&gt; New Window (called window 2)
4. In the new window, Open D:\Project again

expected:
New Window, the window 2, will also have the folder D:\Project just like window 1.

Result:
Instead of opening the D:\Project in window 2, it give focus to window 1 and leave window 2 sitll open nothing.

Reason:
1. I am working with multi monitors, at least 2, and 1 monitor will most likely only able to hold 2 tabs at max so that i can compare code within the same project. I will need another window to put the other tab even though it's under the same folder, maybe it's not a problem i i have the same monitor resolution, but currently, i am using one laptop monitor (1366x768) and additional lcd monitor (1920x1080) which give problem if i try to display the editor under resolution (3286x ????) just to compare codes.
1. There is no option to let the editor tab float as independent window

    <Title>HoverProvider text using Markdown, URL to file + Line number?</Title>
    <Description>I've been using HoverProvider to quickly display the origin file of a user function in Lua.
I'm using the Markdown syntax for creating a clickable link, which opens the file in the editor:

`[c:\temp\file.lua](file:c:\temp\file.lua)` -&gt; [c:\temp\file.lua](#here)

I'm wondering if this link syntax also supports line number, and if it does, what is the syntax of it?

I believe this question is also generally related to all places where an extension can display text formatted with Markdown.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. All I have to do is open Visual Studio Code and it will give me these error. I am not able to save, and some of the keyboard commands don't work such as backspace.

Troubleshooting:
1. I've deleted all my extensions from `~/.vscode/extensions` but still experience the same errors.
2. I've completely uninstalled VS Code by using App Cleaner to make sure I got every app file possible, yet it still gave errors after I installed a fresh copy from the website. 

Screenshot:

**EDIT:** Actually... I think I may have found the issue. This happens when I open a remote file from within FileZilla by right clicking on the **remote** filename and clicking on view/edit. What this does is open the file in VSCode and shows the temp location of the file as a very long string.

I feel like it may be this that is causing the issue because after downloading the file and **then** opening it, everything is working fine. 

Is there any log that I can submit to see if I'm right?

Hi, I'm developing [console-wrapper](https://github.com/fabiodamasceno/vscode-console-wrapper) , that is an extension for javascript console.log (other languages support will be added soon) and I need some access for clipboard content in Extensions API. I think this methods should be enough for most of cases:
- vscode.clipboard.getContent()
- vscode.clipboard.setContent()

Some event handlers should be useful, too, like:

-vscode.clipboard.beforeContentLoad()
-vscode.clipboard.onContentLoad()
-vscode.clipboard.onContentLoaded()

Steps for the extension:
- user copy some text;
  - when ctrl+shift+q text is wrapped with console.log and inserted at below line.

hugs,

    <Title>Tooltip background color</Title>
    <Description>_From @rogeralsing on March 29, 2016 9:17_

The tooltips when hovering method names etc. are somewhat hard to read as the background and syntax highlight is the same as the rest of the code window.
it would be nice if at least the background color was a bit different, (lighter/darker depending on theme)

For example, the peek definition makes things much clearer, there is a distinct bg color that shows that this block of code is from somewhere else.

It would be extremely nice if extensions had the ability to create menus, both on the top of the screen as well as adding items to the context menu. This could be controlled through a separate .json file or by adding a section to the `contributes` section of `package.json`.

    <Title>VsCode doesn't indicate the "currently debugged thread" when multilple threads are stopped during debugging.</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.12-alpha
- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04
- Debugging using Microsoft cpp debugger, but will happen in any "stop-all" style debugger.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile following C++ code

```
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

using namespace std;
#define NUM_THREADS 5

void *PrintHello(void *threadid)
long tid;
tid = (long)threadid; //set a breakpoint here
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World! Thread ID, " &lt;&lt; tid &lt;&lt; endl;
pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main()
{
pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
int rc;
int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; NUM_THREADS; i++) { //set a breakpoint here
cout &lt;&lt; "main() : creating thread, " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
rc = pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL,
PrintHello, (void *)i);
if (rc) {
cout &lt;&lt; "Error:unable to create thread," &lt;&lt; rc &lt;&lt; endl;
exit(-1);
}
}
pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```
1. Set two breakpoints in the lines with comments "//set a breakpoint here" 
2. press F5 3~5 times 
3. Notice, that if a breakpoint or step causes the threads to switch, the UI does not indicate which thread is currently stepping. Multiple callstacks may be displayed, which can be confusing.

 Keep in mind when you scale the font, the images to the left need to be scaled as well.

    <Description>Similar to [`atom.commands.onWillDispatch` and `atom.commands.onDidDispatch`](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.3.2/CommandRegistry). This would be useful for extensions wanting to perform some action before or after a command is performed.

Being able to determine the source of the event would be useful in such an API (mouse vs keyboard vs command palette).

    <Title>Extensions with console-like behavior</Title>
    <Description>Currently with the extensions API, we have access to output channels (creation and access through `vscode.window.createOutputChannel()`).  And likewise, we can get adhoc user input through `vscode.window.showInputBox`.

I think what would be really helpful is if the extensions API included the capability to have a console-like experience, much like the **debug console** has (input part of the experience with the output).  Not necessarily for "debugging" purposes, but for a more consistent and extended user experience exchange for ongoing for **user input creation**, then **VS Code output consumption**, followed by more **user input creation**, ... so on and so forth.

At the moment, the `showInputBox()` functionality with the output channel can seem like a one-time exchange, without the continuity of a input/output console (like the debugger console).

    <Description>I'd like to implement an alternative jump to file that uses a [custom matching algorithm](https://github.com/spion/fuzzy-matcher). Is this possible, or is the extension API too limited to do this?

The closest thing seems to be [the quickpick api](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#QuickPickOptions), and it falls short. Perhaps `QuickPickItem` could be allowed to implement a `matches(input:string):boolean` method?

    <Title>Feature request: multiple commands in tasks.json</Title>
    <Description>Hello,

For now, tasks.json allows only one command to be set.
It would be great to be able to have multiple commands, one for each tool something like this:

``` json
{
    "taskCommands": [
        {
            "command": "npm",
            "isShellCommand": true,
            "suppressTaskName": true,
            "showOutput": "always",
            "args": ["run"],
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "taskName": "npm:test",
                    // Make this the default build command.
                    "isBuildCommand": true,
                    // Show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.
                    "args": [
                        "debug:test"
                    ]
                },
 {
                    "taskName": "npm:test2",
                    // Make this the default build command.
                    "isBuildCommand": true,
                    // Show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.
                    "args": [
                        "debug:test2"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "command": "gulp",
            "isShellCommand": true,
            "suppressTaskName": true,
            "showOutput": "always",
            "args": [],
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "taskName": "gulp:test",
                    // Make this the default build command.
                    "isBuildCommand": true,
                    // Show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.
                    "args": [
                        "debug:test"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

I hope you will take my request into consideration and hope this will help to enhance vscode.

Thank you in advance for your feedback.

    <Title>story for pulling in remote origin topic branch that already exists into local repo</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11
- OS Version: win10 10586.164

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open folder containing clone of remote origin master
2. click on git branch status area in bottom left corner, or enter ctrl+p or f1+&gt;Git: Checkout, and enter name of remote origin branch you want to local copy to reference.  the git ouput window shows "git checkout -q -b someTopicBranch" and "git fetch" were executed.
3.  folder doesn't contain copy of remote origin topic branch so from command line enter "git.exe config -l --local" where you'll see that branch.someTopicBranch.remote/.merge entries are not present
4.  from command line enter "git branch -u origin/someTopicBranch" or "git branch --set-upstream-to=someTopicBranch" to update local config to contain branch.someTopicBranch.remote/.merge entries
5.  from vscode you can now use git | ... | pull == "git pull" to retrieve the contents of the remote origin someTopicBranch that already existed

My thinking is that steps 3 thru 5 should be automated for you in case where you are not looking to create new topic branch and optionally later push it into remote origin but rather create local repo topic branch into which you sync the details of remote origin copy of topic branch that already exists.

    <Title>Open with Code not visible for unprivileged users</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in as a unprivileged user
2. Run the VS Code installer as Administrator and enter password
3. Tap both "Open with Code" checkboxes in the wizard
4. Right-click on a file or folder 

The "Open with Code" option is missing. I have not investigated this more than the reproduce steps above so it may be unrelated to the user being unprivileged.

  Node 4.1.1
- OS Version: Windows 7 Enterprise Version 6.1.7601

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start VSCode.
2. Press Control + a few times because you're getting older and your monitor is very large. :)
3. Right click on some text. 

Expected result: The context menu opens at the mouse pointer. 

Actual result: The context menu opens at what would be the right location if you hadn't increased the font size. 

Notes: 
1. I could not for the life of me find a way to search these issues, apologies in advance if this is a dupe. 
2. This is a new bug for this update - this didn't used to happen.

    <Title>Format Code doesn't work for an unsaved buffer</Title>
    <Description>- VSCode Version: 0.10.11
- OS Version: Windows 7

Steps to Reproduce:
- Open a new buffer (Ctrl+N)
- Set the language mode to JavaScript (Ctrl-K M)
- Type some code with wrong indentation, e.g.

```
var x = 1;
    var y = 2;
```
- Try to format the code (Alt+Shift+F)

**What happens**: Nothing.
**What is expected to happen**: Code should be formatted.

I tried to fix this bug, but realized that it might be a design issue:
- Code formatting is carried out by an external plugin (in case of JS it's the TS-Server)
- VSC issues a corresponding "format" message [formattingProvider.ts:102](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/4da8ef4e95e423071596a64b3d37c638b6700a62/extensions/typescript/src/features/formattingProvider.ts#L102) to the TS-Server consisting params of the format `{"file":null,"line":1,"offset":1,"endLine":25,"endOffset":3}`.
- The TS-Server tries to open file `null` from its `syntaxTreeCache` which leads to this error:
  
  "{"seq":0,"type":"response","command":"format","request_seq":76,"success":false,
  "message":"Error processing request. Cannot read property 'replace' of null"}"

which is caught at [formattingProvider.ts:105](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/4da8ef4e95e423071596a64b3d37c638b6700a62/extensions/typescript/src/features/formattingProvider.ts#L105) but not logged anywhere, apparently.

So the issue is, an unsaved buffer has no file path and, hence, is not accessible for the TS-Server. potentially, this might be fixed by using some internal fake path, which would be known to the TS-Server's `cacheSyntaxTree`. Apparently, a physical file is not a hard requirement. Initially I assumed, that VSC only sends a file name to the TS-Server, who reads the file, computes the range and sends the formatted code back. However, a fast test disproved this:
- save a buffer to a file
- delete file immediately from the FS 
- change the code and try to format it
- ensure it worked

So: the TS-Server uses the filename but reads the file content from some internal cache shared between VSC and TSS. This cache might be the right place to reference the unsaved buffer. But if I'm right, it's a subject for a major design change.

If you have better suggestions because I overlooked something feel free to inform me and I could make another attempt.

    <Title>Exclude files and folders listed in .gitignore</Title>
    <Description>Hello,

I just tried VS Code recently and I was surprised to see it didn't exclude the files and folders listed in my `.gitignore` file.

I think an option allowing us to hide those files in the Explorer would be really nice.

Here is how Atom does it:

&lt;img width="770" alt="screen shot 2016-03-07 at 10 31 42" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/89233/13565344/d476f9ea-e44f-11e5-896b-3a637ee36153.png"&gt;

And when this option isn't on, Atom colorizes the excluded files like that:

&lt;img width="167" alt="screen shot 2016-03-07 at 10 36 52" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/89233/13565471/8abf97a2-e450-11e5-94ad-771193dd25c0.png"&gt;

    <Title>Configure selector keys for suggest widget</Title>
    <Description>Whenever suggest widget (e.g. a completion list) is summoned (by a configured trigger character, e.g. `.` or `&gt;`), both Tab and Enter are valid for selection by default. More than once I've accidentally accepted the suggestion rather than doing a line break as intended.

https://github.com/mitaki28/vscode-clang/issues/8 is a good example of this where a `completionProvider` is configured and triggered by `&gt;`, causing issues when trying to do a line break:
![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1016104/13473657/4b754dec-e088-11e5-8aa3-35e09aee946a.png)

At first I thought I'd suggest that the default should be only Tab to avoid all of this. But then I came to think that perhaps more ideally this should be configurable by the extension that registers a provider with `triggerCharacters`. What do you think?

    <Title>disable autocomplete in .txt files</Title>
    <Description>The code completion functionality often gets in the way when typing prose into a text file. For example, if I were writing this comment in a .txt file with VS Code and tried to type the word fun immediately followed by the Enter key, I'd automatically have the word "functionality" instead, because Code "learned" from the first sentence above that "fun" might be the beginning of "functionality."

It's great that this is apparently turned off by default in Markdown files. Can the same default be applied to .txt files? It's unlikely that any useful word-completion heuristic can be deduced from the content of most text files.

    <Title>"Duplicate function implementation." Error underlining</Title>
    <Description>When a JavaScript function is defined and committed to git, vscode takes further changes to the file and incorrectly notifies the user of a duplicate function implementation because of the older git version of the code and the edited version are thought to be different functions by vscode. After the change to the file is committed to git, the incorrect error underlining goes away.

It should become something like this when the panel is sufficiently narrow so the button/title doesn't go missing.

    <Title>Snippet list does not render correctly</Title>
    <Description>#3159

When looking through the snippet list I get some strange rendering.  

There are definitely 5 snippets in the list but only 4 show up until I arrow through the complete set of 5.  Once I did that the list rendered correctly.  I would not have known there were 5 items if the sample screenshot did not show 5 (vs the 4 I could see).

I also saw some other partial rendering issues such as the double up in the image below.

    <Description>If I run VSCode as **root** from bash on Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu/Kubuntu it doesn't respond on startup.
This problem occurred on fresh installs, in VMs, on both of my devices.
However running a quick `chown -R root:root /` fixed the problem (It is a local VM, so whatever).
[Disclaimer: Know what you do, do not copy paste that into your terminal]

Anyone else experienced the same on a Ubuntu based distro lately? On Debian/Arch it works just fine.

BTW: I couldn't install the omnisharp plugin for Atom because of the exact same reason.

The error is that Omnisharp is not starting "[ERROR:OmniSharp.Dnx.DesignTimeHostManager] Failed to launch DesignTimeHost in a timely fashion." 
But the main question is if code should include developers' names or be more generically named.

    <Title>Installing Extensions behind proxy fails</Title>
    <Description>On Windows, when I am behind a proxy server I am able to get the list of possible extensions to install but every time I try to install one of them it gives an error that it can't find the proxy server.  

Note in the error message that I replaced the real address with the text proxyAddress.  I did notice that some of the message has the port number appended twice.  

I tried using both the system environment variable for http_proxy and https_proxy as well as setting it just in the VS Code settings.json file.   Same error on both.

```
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND proxyAddress:911 proxyAddress:911:911,    at errnoException (dns.js:25:10),    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:76:26)

This also breaks the install system, as the extension is half installed, I had to remove the extensions folder to fix that.

    <Title>vsce should package closure without devDependencies</Title>
    <Description>Using mainly the default generated files from `generator-code`, a significant number of devDependencies (mostly recursive) are pulled in - mainly because of Mocha. For development this is fine (I love Mocha). But why blindly package them all with `vsce package`? Perhaps create an output directory of everything `vsce ls` would find but _node_modules_, then run `npm install --production` and package that directory. Would certainly reduce the size of VSCode extensions. Mine - with only the addition of 1 small module (with no dependencies itself) is over 5MB.

    <Title>Add support for ES2016 Object Spread Initializer</Title>
    <Description>Object Spread Initializers is a proposed feature of ES2016 and is very useful when writing Redux reducers. The syntax is supported in babel, but when using the feature in Visual Studio Code it will mark the spread operator as a syntax error.

See: https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/blob/master/Spread.md
for more information of the feature.

It would be very nice if Visual Studio Code did not mark the use of this feature as an error with a red squiggly.

The current behavior in Visual Studio Code is also described in Issue #1640

    <Title>Random placement for Snippets in autocomplete</Title>
    <Description>The CSS snippets always show up in the auto-complete suggestions. This isn't ideal for CSS when completing values as they insert a bunch of properties, which isn't valid in that context. This isn't terrible as they're hidden at the end of the list, but in the latest code, they are included randomly, with one of them mostly (always?) showing first in the list:

See gradient, border and transition dispersed through the list, with border as the first completion
![screen shot 2016-01-12 at 6 21 47 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/465069/12283201/5c619c7e-b959-11e5-9a7e-96dee55dcd9b.png)

They should be last like the old behaviour, and ideally not show up for value completions in CSS (although perhaps there could be snippets that are valid to be inserted in that position?)

Ideally there would be some kind of weighting or ordering to the list of initial completions, as they seem random currently. They're not in defined order in the source file or alphabetical. In an ideal world, I’d like the CSS wide keywords to be kept together and listed last and property specific features first (they're added that way when generating the file)

    <Title>install extension is slow (needs caching?)</Title>
    <Description>Invoking the command `ext install` repeatedly is really slow.

When you invoke the command, a little blue line scrolls horizontally to show it's doing something (fetching the extension database?), and eventually displays a list of extensions you can install. Repeatedly invoking the command should cache this work from last time, but it seems to re-fetch (or whatever it's doing) every time, which is fairly annoying when I want to install a few extensions at once.

    <Title>Corrupted extension in the extensions folder</Title>
    <Description>(extracted from #1095)

Some time ago I've uninstalled the tslint extension. The extension was not completely removed. 
It was still in the extensions folder and consisted of empty folders only and no package.json file.

I cannot reproduce how this happened but we should recover from such incomplete extensions, so that the user doesn't have to go in manually and clean-up the extension.

On startup there is a warning that the extension is incomplete, i.e., that there is no package.json. This warning should be shown to the user and there should be a command provided that allows cleaning up such a partial extension.

    <Title>Can't use Git command line when Visual Studio Code is open</Title>
    <Description>It looks like Visual Studio Code locks some files and I can't use the command line Git client when it is open. Closing Visual Studio Code resolves this issue. The index.lock file did not exist when I checked for it so it must be preventing the command line client from working in some other way. Here's the output from the command line client:

Updating ca3f107..3e957b8
fatal: Unable to create 'C:/dev/GIS/.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.

    <Title>"Install Extensions" does not cache list</Title>
    <Description>Each time I do `Cmd-Shift-P` and `Install Extensions` it takes ages for the list of extensions to come up. Like literally a minute or more. 

And it doesn't seem to cache the result. It's like it has to download them each time, even if it's only a second or two after I last pulled it up.

Frustrating - like using yum in Fedora used to be. 

apt-get in Ubuntu would cache results and was always more perfomant and responsive, with a slight cost in synchronisation with the latest available packages. 

It would work for me if it downloaded the latest package list when requested - and continued to download it even when it loses focus and closes. And then uses that cached list until the program is restarted, or does the same background load if it is opened again after ten minutes. 

That way I have a delay the first time I open it, but I can keep working. At the moment I have to literally stop working _on_anything_ and wait for the list to load.

    <Title>Request: Git features should be available when working on a project that's below the git repo root</Title>
    <Description>Howdy!

Due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm currently stuck working on a project that's a subdirectory in part of a larger git repo. To open the entire repo directory would be a bit of a pain as well. I can work on the project just fine otherwise but none of the git features are currently available which is a disappointment.

What's preventing Code from being able to use Git regardless of the opened project folder location (relative to the git root)?

The contrived example layout:

```
/projects/engine/ &lt;--- root of the repo
/projects/engine/tools/my_application/ &lt;--- here sits a package.json, gulpfile.js, etc etc
```

In my project's root, I have a `jsconfig.json` file with the following contents:

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES6",
        "module": "commonjs"
    },
    "files": [
        "app/"
    ]
}
```

The file in question lives inside the `app` folder.
